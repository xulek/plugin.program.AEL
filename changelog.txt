[B]Speculative/futuristic features[/B]

WIP      [CORE] Complete Extranafart support for Categories/Launchers/ROMs.
         Does this make sense?

WIP      [CORE] Think about exporting the AEL platform database using JSON-LD in accordance to
         Garbear's idea.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=295463&pid=2625754#pid2625754

WIP      [SCRAPERS] Advanced fuzzy search engine based on the Levenshtein Distance algorithm,
         for both online and offline scrapers. There is a Python implementation of
         the algorithm here: https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy

WIP      [SCRAPERS] LaunchBox Games Database scraper.
         NOTE Do not implement this. AEL offline scraper is more than enough.
         Apparently LaunchBox GamesDB started as a copy of TheGamesDB. Currently there is no
         API to access LaunchBox GamesDB but an XML with all the database info can be downloaded.
         See http://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/
         See https://bitbucket.org/jasondavidcarr/launchbox/issues/902/api-access-to-launchbox

WIP      [SCRAPERS] Fix GameFAQs scraper.
         It has been a while since this scraper is not working any more.
         GameFAQs does not have an API. Should this scraper being removed???
         Currently the GameFAQs metadata scraper works well. The GameFAQs asset scraper
         does not work due to changes in GameFAQs. See the comments of method
         GameFAQs._load_assets_from_page()

WIP      [SCRAPERS] Persistent scraper cache browser. Ability to browse the stored scraper
         searches. Also, context menu to delete stored cached data.


[B]Planned features / TODO[/B]

WIP      [CORE] Check out the ListItem constructor offscreen parameter in Leia. It can
         dramatically speed up ListItem creation and population.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=329315&pid=2711937#pid2711937

         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=276002&pid=2643218#pid2643218

WIP      [CORE] Support for Advanced MAME Launcher exported virtual launchers or
         Read Only Launchers. This feature requires AML 0.9.X
         AML creates the Category "Arcade (AML)" and places the exported launchers there.

WIP      [CORE] Use Libretro_BIOS_cores.json for the Retroarch BIOS audit and not the internal
         database. However, Libretro_BIOS_cores.json does not have the ROM size.

WIP      [MULTIDISC] Edit multidisc ROMs. In general, improve the support for
         multidisc ROMs.

WIP      [MULTIDISC] Fix artwork support for multi-disc ROMs.

[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.10.0 | xx xxxxxx 2020[/B]

FEATURE  [CORE] First AEL version to support Python 3 and Kodi 19 Matrix.
         The plan is to release AEL 0.10.0 once Kodi Matrix reaches the release candidate stage.

WIP      [CORE] Rename the plugin from `plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher` to
         `plugin.program.AEL`. Create a development version `plugin.program.AEL.dev` that
         can coexist with the stable version. See how AML does it.

WIP      [CORE] Massive AEL refactoring. Thanks a lot to Chrisism for the patch!

WIP      [CORE] Support Kodi VFS and ROMs in remote filesystems for Retroplayer.
         See Chrisism patch in Github. Copy remote ROMs for external launchers?

WIP      [CORE] Proper support for Retroplayer launchers. Add functionality like
         Retroplayer core selection for each platform.

WIP      [CORE] Automatic generation of 3D Boxes using BoxFront and BoxSpine.
         Copy this feature from AML.

WIP      [CORE] Automatic generation of BoxTextures from BoxBack, BoxSpine and BoxFront.
         Copy this feature from AML.

WIP      [MANUALS] Port the PDF manual reader from AML into AEL.


[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.9.10 | xx July 2020[/B]

WIP      [CORE] Unified ROM artwork directory. This will require heavy changes in categories.xml.
         I still have to think how to properly implement this. This is related to the
         desing of a prototype Kodi games database.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2865413#pid2865413
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2867785#pid2867785

WIP      [CORE] New fields in database to be prepared for the future. See NOTES.md

WIP      [CORE] Support for BoxSpine artwork. Support for BoxTextures artwork.
         Have a look at LaunchBox for other types of artwork that may be interesting.

WIP      [CORE] New Utility "Delete ROMs redundant artwork"
         Redundant artwork is orphaned artwork. This is not easy to code specially
         for launcher with recursive scan where ROMs can be in different
         directories.

WIP      [FAVOURITES] Change the way artwork is stored in Favourites, Launchers and
         Categories directories. Avoid using IDs in the artwork name unless absolutely
         necessary. Use same scheme as ROM collections.

WIP      [ROM AUDIT] Separate the ROM Audit code from the Parent/Clone code.

WIP      [ROM AUDIT] Add an option to create a default Parent ROM for Redump DATs or NoIntro DATs
         with no PClone information. See NOTES.md for implementation ideas.

WIP      [ROM AUDIT] Options to generate the 1G1R parent list, like prefer ROMs from Europe,
         Japan or USA. This resembles what NARS No-Intro filtering does.

WIP      [SCRAPERS] Improve the Offline Scraper. Improve the quality of the databases.

WIP      [SCRAPERS] Change the Offline Scraper format from XML to JSON. Include the new fields
         `parent` **string**, `region` **list of strings** and `language` **list of strings**.
         In general, write down the specifications of the new Offline Scraper database and
         have a look at NOTES.md for guidelines. Create the XML databases to be merged with the
         No-Intro/Redump DATs, also giving support to Extra ROMs (hacks, etc.).

WIP      [SCRAPERS] In ScreenScraper, check for daily allowance and scraper overflows in general.

WIP      [SCRAPERS] ScreenScraper must choose the correct artwork depending on the region/language.
         AEL must have an official list of regions/languages, extracted from the No-Intro/Redump
         DATs, to translate to ScreenScraper values. A No-Intro filename parser is also
         required.


[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.9.9 | 13 March 2020[/B]

FEATURE  [COLLECTIONS] When exporting ROM Collections assets are always exported. The option
         to export only metadata has been removed. When importing assets are also always
         imported to the ROM Collection asset directory.

FEATURE  [COLLECTIONS] Current way of storing the collection artwork, in a unified JSON file,
         is not good. Think of a good way to exporting collections (for example, store the
         artwork in a subdirectory).

FEATURE  [COLLECTIONS] Do not consolidate Collection artwork before exporting. Also, when
         importing always import to the Collection artwork directory. Exported artwork
         collection filenames in the JSON file must be relative, not absolute paths.

FEATURE  [COLLECTIONS] Store Collection ROMs artwork as filename_platformCompactName_assetType.png
         and not filename_ROMID_assetType.png. This solves a lot of problems of duplicate
         artwork. ROMs with same name are allowed on different platforms but not on the
         same platform, which makes sense. Collection own artwork use the special
         platform name 'collection'.

FEATURE  [CORE] Rename offline scraper XML databases to use new platform name.

FEATURE  [CORE] Changed the Offline Scraper XML fields. Now the XML files are not compatible
         with HyperSpin but they make more sense.

FEATURE  [CORE] Update the platform icons. Github issue #112.

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] MAME offline scraper: include NPlayers field. Take it from nplayers.ini

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Store when there is a bad JSON from the scrapers for further
         analysis. Working for ScreenScraper scraper.

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Update MAME Offline Scraper database to version latest version 0.219.

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Include isBIOS, isDevice, isMechanical in AOL MAME database. This is
         required to filter BIOSes and Devices in MAME launchers.

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Filter MAME BIOSes, Devices and Mechanical machines with the new
         Offline Scraper JSON databases. Use the offline scraper DB to determine what
         is a BIOS/Device/Mechanical in MAME.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2697000#pid2697000

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Add a delay of 1200 ms between downloads to ScreenScraper scraper
         to avoid scraper overloading. This is configurable in the scraper object.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2923181#pid2923181

FEATURE  [CORE] New Utility "Check Launcher ROMs sync status"

FEATURE  [CORE] New Utility "Check ROMs artwork image integrity"
         Sometimes the scrapers download wrong/corrupt data, or produce 0 sized files
         if a file is open() and there is an exception. Sometimes a JPG image is renamed
         as PNG, etc. Check that all artwork have correct file extensions, etc.

FEATURE  [CORE] Extra ROMs directory. Extra ROMs are not audited. The extra ROMs directory
         is intended for ROM translations and hacks that should not be taken into account
         in the ROM audit.

FEATURE  [CORE] New Utility "Show detected No-Intro/Redump DATs"
         This utility shows the automatically detected No-Intro/Redump DATs.
         Create addon settings for the No-Intro DAT directory and the Redump DAT directory.

FEATURE  [CORE] New Utility "Check Retroarch Launchers" This utility checks all Retroarch
         launchers to verify if the core set with -L exists.

FEATURE  [CORE] Remove the LAUNCHER_DMODE_1G1R Launcher display mode. The Launcher display
         modes will be LAUNCHER_DMODE_FLAT and LAUNCHER_DMODE_PCLONE, like AML.

FEATURE  [ROM AUDIT] Current way of doing the ROM audit is inconvenient. User has to set a DAT
         file. Create two new settings: a) directory for No-Intro DATs, b) directory for Redump
         DATs. AEL must be able to choose the DAT file according to the platform.
         Some fields in categories.xml have been changed.

FEATURE  [ROM AUDIT] Create a tool to select the No-Intro/Redump DAT file automatically for
         each platform. This will be very useful for the new Offline Scraper database and
         for the ROM tag histogram.

FEATURE  [CORE] In the "Global ROM Audit statistics" report show only the audited launchers.

FEATURE  [CORE] Increase the number of platforms to include all No-Intro, Redump and
         Libretro platforms. This is in preparation of the Kodi Games Database.

FEATURE  [CORE] Settings to hide Utilities and Global Reports from root window.

FEATURE  [CORE] Setting for skin kiosk mode. See pull request in Github.

FIX      Fixed crash when setting display_launcher_roms was True.

FIX      When fixing ROM Collections the order of the ROM list is lost. Repaired items are
         placed at the end of the list and the original order is lost.
         This was a very long standing bug.

FIX      Fix crash when using "Export ROM metadata to NFO files"
         Crash was related to the deprecated kodi_busydialog_ON()

FIX      TheGamesDB URL API has changed. Verify that the scraper is working OK. Github issue #109.
         See https://forums.thegamesdb.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&p=2228

FIX      ScreenScraper crashes for aliased platforms. Github issue #113.


[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.9.8 | 16 September 2019[/B]

FEATURE  [CORE] Added new artwork contributed by Sagrath.

FEATURE  [CORE] In XML configuration files, support multiple <args> tag and deprecate <args_extra>

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] In ScreenScraper, if a ZIP file contains one and only one archive
         use it to calculate checksums and not the ZIP file itself.

FIX      Fixed a path related issue in _command_add_new_category() and
         _command_render_all_ROMs().


[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.9.8-beta1 | 06 September 2019[/B]

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Copy scraper stuff from master branch by Chrisism.

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Fix MobyGames scraper and use new MobyGames API.
         See http://www.mobygames.com/info/api

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Fix TheGamesDB scraper.
         There has been a change in the web site including a new API.
         See https://github.com/Wintermute0110/plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher/issues/75

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Have a look at ScreenScraper and consider it for an online scraper.
         See https://www.screenscraper.fr/
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2622839#pid2622839

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Fix ArcadeDB scraper. Use the new ArcadeDB API.
         It has been a while since this scraper is not working any more.

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Fix AEL Offline Scraper.

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Add support for ScummVM platform in the Offline Scraper.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2629084#pid2629084

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Warn user if missing scraper API keys, required stuff, etc., before scraping.
         Also, improve the scraper error reporting and the disabling of the scraper object
         if the web site is overloaded.
         Make sure TGDB scraper works like a charm. And then update the rest.

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Utility to check TheGamesDB monthly allowance.

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Utility to check MobyGames monthly allowance.

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Utility to check ScreenScraper monthly allowance.

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Make sure all scraper platforms are OK and synchronised with AEL platforms.

FEATURE  [SCRAPERS] Option to rescrape all ROM assets in a similar fashion to
         "Scan ROMs local artwork". Create a menu entry in "Edit Launcher", "Manage ROMs",
         "Scrape ROMs artwork".
         "Scrape ROMs artwork" will use the same scraper settings in options as the ROM Scanner.
         I think the best location for the code is in the ScraperStrategy class.
         See https://github.com/Wintermute0110/plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher/issues/72

FEATURE  [CORE] Create a couple of new ROM context menus, "Manage Recently played ROM" and 
         "Manage Most played ROM". Both will have the following options: "Delete this ROM",
         "Delete all Unlinked/Broken ROMs".
         See AML for an implementation.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2698811#pid2698811

FEATURE  [CORE] New ROMs artwork type 3D Boxes, asked by Rufoo.

FEATURE  [CORE] New entry in root menu named "Utilities"

FEATURE  [CORE] Move stuff from addon settings into the Utilities menu, including the
         database upgrading functions.

FEATURE  [CORE] Make sure AEL never crashes when rendering the root window, even if 
         categories.xml is corruped. Users must be able to access the Utilities menu always to
         be able to upgrade the database. In case of crash when rendering the root window,
         ask the user to update the databases (in the case the crash is due to a missing 
         key in dictionary).

FEATURE  [CORE] New properties to notify skins about Std launchers, ROM launchers, Categories,
         and number of items in a Launcher. Upgrade documentation in SKINNING.md.

FIX      Fixed crash when editing Launchr Title in context menu.

FIX      Fixed crash in the ROM Scanner when Launcher had unconfigured ROM asset paths.


[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.9.7-beta2 | 19 November 2017[/B]

FIX      Currently AEL multid-disc parser supports "Rom name (disc 1).bin".
         Fixed to also support "Rom name (disk 1).bin".
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2656844#pid2656844

[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.9.7-beta1 | 07 October 2017[/B]

FEATURE  Added a lot of new platforms.

FEATURE  Add an option to see ROM Maps image if it exists.
         Add an option in context menu "View ROM/Launcher".

FEATURE  Audit all launchers. Check if app exists, ROM path exits, artwork paths are configured,
         etc. When a user uses XML to import configurations it is easy to make a typo when
         writing directory names, etc. This command will report if AEL configuration is OK.

FEATURE  Use substituted artwork from the Parent/Clone group.
         So far implemented only in "Edit Launcher", "Manage ROMs", "Rescan ROMs local assets/artwork"

FEATURE  I discovered that in the ROM Scanner most of the time is spend looking for artwork. Before,
         I though it was the Offline scraper the culprit. Instead of using FileName().exists()
         create a set with all files in the directory and use that for the search.
         Implemented only in "Edit Launcher", "Manage ROMs", "Rescan ROMs local assets/artwork",
         must be ported to the ROM scanner if it works well (faster than the current approach).

FEATURE  ROM scanner should be able to scrap all assets, not just the ones supported by the
         selected scraper. This will require a redesign of the current scraping engine.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2628383#pid2628383 and next post.

FEATURE  Make sure all asset scraper requests are cached in the ROM scanner. For example, Title
         scraper choose a game in the list, then Snap scraper for the same ROM must use the
         cached selected game.

FEATURE  Port to the ROM scanner the asset file cache. This will increase the scanning speed a lot.

FEATURE  ROMs in UNC paths. It seems Retroarch added UNC path support recently.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2647152#pid2647152

         [Windows]
         Workaround in _run_process() to add an extra '\\' character if argument starts with
         a '\\'. This is to fix shlex.split() behaviour.
         
         Tested in Windows only with the following configuration:
             <ROM_path>\\SERVER_NAME\AEL-ROMs\sega-genesis\</ROM_path>
             <ROM_asset_path>smb://SERVER_NAME/AEL-assets/sega-genesis/</ROM_asset_path>

         This configuration also works in Windows:
             <ROM_path>smb://SERVER_NAME/AEL-ROMs/sega-genesis/</ROM_path>
             <ROM_asset_path>smb://SERVER_NAME/AEL-assets/sega-genesis/</ROM_asset_path>

         Artwork is stored in JSON DB as "smb://SERVER_NAME/AEL-assets/sega-genesis/boxbacks\\Sonic.jpg"
         ROMs are saved in JSON DB as "\\\\SERVER_NAME\\AEL-ROMs\\sega-genesis\\Sonic.md"

         Kodi artwork does not work with paths like \\SERVER_NAME\AEL-ROMs\sega-genesis\image.png.
         Correct path for artwork is smb://SERVER_NAME/AEL-ROMs/sega-genesis/image.png.

         Retroarch requires a ROM path like \\SERVER_NAME\AEL-ROMs\sega-genesis\Sonic.md.

FEATURE  Launcher flag to enable non-blocking launchers. This is required for wrapper scripts
         that close Kodi to avoid problems (such as Kodi getting gamepad commands instead of the
         launcher app or Kodi running in standalone mode withouth a Window manager).

FEATURE  Ability to import launcher and categories assets in the XML configuration files.
         Create a working example for Gamestarter addon. Also, refactor the AEL asset library.

FEATURE  Rename "Studio" database field to "Developer" in Launchers/ROMs.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=295463&pid=2625754#pid2625754

FEATURE  New Launcher asset 's_controller' for Console/Computer controller picture.

FEATURE  Renamed 's_thumb' -> 's_icon' in Categories/Launchers/Collections.

FEATURE  Renamed 's_flyer' -> 's_poster' in Categories/Launchers/Collections.

FEATURE  Renamed 'roms_default_thumb' -> 'roms_default_icon' in Launchers.

FEATURE  Improved Retroplayer support.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=295463&pid=2620489#pid2620489
         and https://alwinesch.github.io/group__python__xbmcgui__listitem.html#ga0f1e91e1d5aa61d8dd0eac90e8edbf18

FEATURE  Audit Retroarch BIOSes in System directory.

FEATURE  Scan for artwork in the Parent/Clone group of a ROM. Implemented only in the context
         menu "Edit Launcher", "Manage ROM List", "Rescan ROMs local assets/artwork".

FEATURE  Support for <Launcher_NFO> tag in XML configuration files.

FEATURE  Preserve path_title, path_snap, etc. when exporting a Launcher into an XML file.

FEATURE  Add an option to suspend/resume joystick support at launch. This is to prevent Kodi
         and the launched app to grab joystick events.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2627128#pid2627128
         
         Cannot be implemented because setting input.enablejoystick does not exist in Krypton
         any more.

FEATURE  Removed ElementTree dependency in addon.xml. It's not longer needed.
         AEL ONLY WORKS ON KRYPTON NOW!!!

FEATURE  Use the <news> tag in addon.xml. In general, have a look at http://kodi.wiki/view/addon.xml
         and modernise addon.xml.

FEATURE  Update code to use new xbmcgui.Dialog().select() useDetails parameter. Get rid of the 
         ImgSelectDialog() class. This need Krypton Beta 4 to run!
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=250936&pid=2438074#pid2438074

FEATURE  Make use of Krypton features in the several dialogs of the addon: new param: "preselect" 
         for Dialog().multiselect() and Dialog().select(). 
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=250936&pid=2327011#pid2327011

FEATURE  Option to group Unknown ROMs as clones or keep them as parents. I realised it is not
         conveninent that the Unknown ROMs are clones in the Parent/Clone view.

FEATURE  1 Game 1 ROM launcher display mode. Copy it from AML.
         Changed launcher['pclone_launcher'] to launcher['launcher_display_mode'] to store the
         display mode in categories.xml database.

FEATURE  Addon option to hide [Browse Offline Scraper].

         See https://github.com/Wintermute0110/plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher/pull/41

FEATURE  Preliminary render support for LaunchBox scraper.

FIX      Fixed launching of BAT files in Windows.

FIX      In order for skin shortcuts and widgets to work OK, addon concurrency must be enabled
         by database read-only commands.

FIX      Fix scraper-related crash in the ROM scanner.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2628382#pid2628382

FIX      When scraper downloads an image the parents JSON must be also updated. In general, every
         time a ROM is modified in the main database the Parents JSON must be updated to keep
         both DBs synchronised!

FIX      Fixed Unicode-related crashes introduced in 0.9.6 in the ROM scanner.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=276002&pid=2642201#pid2642201

         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2582004#pid2582004

FEATURE  Support Redump DAT files. Note that Redump does not include Parent/Clone data so all
         ROMs are Parent ROMs.

FEATURE  New platform Panasonic 3DO.

FEATURE  Update NFO files after scraping. This is useful to interrupt the scanner when scanning
         large collections and resume scanning later.
         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2548998#pid2548998

FEATURE  Allow only one instance of AEL running at a time.
         This prevents multiple launcher execution and also get rids forever of any database
         corruption issues due to concurrency! Thanks Roman_V_M for ideas about the fix.
         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=310697

[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.9.6-beta1 | 5 March 2017[/B]

FEATURE  Import and Export of Launchers configurations. Will be very useful especially for 
         Android users.

FEATURE  Use a Window property to let skins know wheter a launcher OR ROMs are being rendered.
         Set xbmcgui.Window(10001).setProperty('AEL_Content', 'launchers')
             xbmcgui.Window(10001).setProperty('AEL_Content', 'roms')
         It must be set on entering and unset on exiting the plugin.

FEATURE  Use setProperty() to inform the skin about ROM flags:
           1) Favourite status: OK, Unlinked ROM, Unlinked Launcher, Broken
           2) No-Intro status: Have, Missing, Added, Unknown
           3) Parent/Clone status: Parent or Clone (Boolean)

         For example:
           setProperty('AEL_Fav_stat',     'Fav_OK')
           setProperty('AEL_NoIntro_stat', 'NoIntro_Have')
           setProperty('AEL_PClone_stat',  'PClone_Parent')

FEATURE  Update launching mechanism. User Python subprocess module on all platforms and not the
         deprecated os.system(). Current patched subprocess_hack module is from Python 2.4. Current 
         Python version in Kodi is 2.7.
         os.system(), os.open(), etc. are deprecated, and the subprocess module should be used 
         instead for all platforms. A parser of arguments must be coded in order to use the 
         subprocess module.

FEATURE  Log emulator/standalone launcher stdout/stderr into a file. Requires new launching
         mechanism based on subprocess module. Have a look to AML for an implementation.

FEATURE  Add nplayers metadata field to ROMs. Billyc999 database has nplayers NFO.
         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2407055#pid2407055

         implementation.
         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2495480#pid2495480

         AL ROM scanner only added the first disc to the database and skipped disc numbers
         from 2 to 9.
         https://github.com/Wintermute0110/plugin.program.advanced.launcher/blob/master/resources/lib/launcher_plugin.py#L2088

         At ROM launching, if any of the strings ['.cd1', '-cd1', '_cd1', ' cd1'] is found on the
         ROMfile basename then the rompath was scanned looking for all the discs. User selected
         the disc number to launch from a select dialog.
         https://github.com/Wintermute0110/plugin.program.advanced.launcher/blob/master/resources/lib/launcher_plugin.py#L1688

         AEL will use a better implementation based on a ROM filename parser. See NOTES.md

FIX      ROM substitution keywords now use $ instead of the ugly %.
         %rom% becomes $rom$

FIX      Added new argument substitution keywords $rombasenoext$, $categoryID$, $launcherID$,
         and $romID$.

[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.9.5~beta1 | 13 December 2016[/B]

FEATURE  New Arcade Database online metadata/asset scraper for MAME ROMs.

FEATURE  Support for several arguments in launcher. This will be useful when using MAME for
         console emulation (MAME consoles from a different region have different names, and an
         European console will typically refuse to run a Japanese game).
         Survey about this: http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2467547#pid2467547

FEATURE  New command SHOW_ALL_ROMS to render all ROMs in all launchers. Will be used by skins.

         between Titles, Snaps and shots in TheGamesDB this only is useful when doing manual
         scraping.

FEATURE  Improve message reporting in Kodi GUI when scanning ROMs.

FEATURE  Improve launcher report and include is a No-Intro audit information.

         then Launcher title.
