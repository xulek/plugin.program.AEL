        <plot>The name is Bond. James Bond. The famous hero of Ian Fleming&apos;s novels returns in this first-person
            shooter, which is based on the movie of the same name. Agent 007 and his friend Alec Trevalyan (a.k.a. Agent
            006) were sent to Soviet Union on a secret mission. But everything goes wrong, James Bond barely escapes,
            and his friend is presumed dead.&amp;#xA;Ten years later, a mysterious organization named &quot;Janus&quot;
            appeared. Commanding a new satellite called &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, the organizations attempts to steal money
            electronically from banks, deleting all evidence of transfer. It&apos;s up to our Agent 007 to venture to
            Soviet Union once again, and to put an end to Janus&apos; ambitions.&amp;#xA;In this 3D action game, you
            control James Bond from a first-person perspective, using a variety of weapons (from knuckles to grenade
            launcher) to eliminate your foes. However, many parts require you to be careful, to stay unnoticed or to
            snipe guards from distance, since they will react to your presence and alarm their comrades. The game is
            divided into missions, and in some of them you&apos;ll have to perform other tasks besides killing your
            enemies: disarm bombs, take pictures of important evidence, or avoid killing scientists. The game features a
            multiplayer mode with a variety of options, and three difficulty levels.

        <plot>007: The World is Not Enough is a James Bond game based on the 1999 movie of the same name. Both game and
            film follow Bond&apos;s investigation of attacks on a British oil tycoon&apos;s new pipeline, while the game
            introduces new areas and backstory not seen in the film. James Bond is a MI5 agent that employs gadgets and
            gunplay. With each mission requiring the player to complete specific objectives outlined in a pre-mission
            briefing.&amp;#xA;In contrast to the PlayStation title of the same name, this version is structured more
            like a successor to Rare&apos;s GoldenEye 007. There are 14 missions with three difficulty settings (Agent,
            Special Agent, 00 Agent), and higher difficulty settings add increasingly complicated objectives to each
            mission. An &quot;Awards&quot; system encourages replay by granting new multiplayer skins, maps, and modes
            for beating target times for single-player levels.&amp;#xA;The game includes a local, split-screen
            multiplayer mode for up to four players, or a combination of computer-controlled bots. Some levels are taken
            from single-player mode, while others are exclusive to multiplayer. New game modes include King of the Hill,
            Capture The Briefcase, and Last Agent Standing. The notorious Golden Gun also returns from GoldenEye 007,
            and retains its one-shot-kill power. Weapon groups and victory conditions can be tweaked at the start of a
            multiplayer match.

            Time Attack - you must pass through all the coloured circles in a designated order and within the least time

            named Gruntilda asks her magical cauldron who is the fairest of them all. Of course, the pot&apos;s answer
            doesn&apos;t please the hag-- he singles out Banjo&apos;s sister, Tooty. When Tooty turns up missing, Banjo
            and his birdie buddy Kazooie set out to find her.&amp;#xA;The worlds in Banjo-Kazooie are gigantic, and
            chock full of crazy items to collect. Musical Notes, Puzzle Pieces (&quot;Jiggies&quot;), Mumbo Tokens, and
            Jinjoes are just some of the swag that Banjo must stuff in his backpack to complete his adventure. While
            some of the necessary items are simply stashed off the beaten path, others will require puzzle solving
            skills to turn up.

            you&apos;re given a time limit of 3 minutes and must catch as more of the fish mentioned in the overview as

            Championship you can select one of the available players and choose the style you want - ski or snowboard.
            You can also change each player&apos;s equipment which includes ski/snowboard and clothes. The game also
            lets you choose in which stage you want to compete and the race type you want to play. Race Type includes
            three options - Free Ride, Slalom and Giant Slalom. In Free Ride you compete against 3 more CPU players, you
            must finish first and before time, which can be renewed at every checkpoint, runs out. In Slalom and Giant
            Slalom you must pass through the flags that are scattered throughout the course and again like in Free Ride
            finish first. The differences between the Slalom-Giant Slalom are the later&apos;s course being wider and
            the flags less. By successfully completing any of the above your players skills like cornering,
            acceleration, etc. are increased.&amp;#xA;2. 2P Battle: in 2P Battle two human players can compete in any of
            the Free Ride-Slalom-Giant Slalom races. It is possible to either choose a player from the game or load a
            previously saved player data from a Controller Pak. There are also no restrictions on the style each player
            will choose. For example one may choose to play with a skier and the other with a snowboarder.&amp;#xA;3.

            to you to clear the path so that nothing gets in the way of the Carrier.&amp;#xA;Blast Corps is a mix of an
            action and a puzzle game where destruction is key. At the start of each level the player is given a certain
            vehicle (ranging from robotic suits, trucks, or bulldozers), and are told to clear the path for the Carrier.
            Players need to use their heavy-duty equipment to destroy any buildings, structures, or monuments that stand
            in the path of the Carrier. The difficulty increases as progress is made, though. Smaller vehicles don&apos;t
            affect certain buildings, and sometimes its not even a building that&apos;s in the way. The player must use
            the resources around them to clear the path. Players may need a train flatbed to fill a gap, or a crane to
            move boxes out of the way. The Carrier is always moving, so once the player is done destroying one
            obstruction, they must get to the next one quickly. While players pursue their mission they must also find
            six scientists scattered throughout the globe to form a think-tank to solve the problem. The Carrier has to
            leave Earth, and it&apos;s your job to ensure that it does!&amp;#xA;Blast Corps features many secrets to
            find. Besides clearing each path for the Carrier, players can go back to a level once ts over to take their
            time and explore. To fully complete a level, players must also find RDU&apos;s (Radiation Dispersal Units)
            which light up on the ground when the player is in close proximity to them. Players must also destroy all of
            the buildings, and rescue all of the homeless civilians, which is done by the T-chopper that accompanies the
            player on every mission. There are also dozens of secret time trial levels that can be found by activating
            special satellite dishes hidden throughout the levels. If the player manages to get all of the secrets in a
            level they receive a second medal, and once all of the gold medals are found the developers have a tiny

            highly explosive version of capture-the-flag. Your goal here is to destroy the enemy team&apos;s gems while
            protecting your own.&amp;#xA;You can choose the number and duration of battles. You can also choose from
            three levels of artificial intelligence for CPU-controlled bombers. When the Ghost option is selected, your
            little guy will return as a wispy double of his old self after he&apos;s gone boom. Ghosts can control a
            normal Bomberman, but they cannot deploy bombs.&amp;#xA;You&apos;ll savor Bomberman 64&apos;s sneaky new
            features, including extremely high explosives and the ability to toss or kick your bombs diagonally. Other
            new features include the ability to pump up bombs, knock foes unconscious, grab and toss unconscious foes,
            and toss or kick bombs diagonally. Bomberman 64 is a blast!

            ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the &apos;90s but was also very popular due
            to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using
            OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).&amp;#xA;At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is
            ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents&apos; cars
            on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to
            damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves
            earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime
            during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups
            strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by
            racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight.&amp;#xA;Carmageddon
            is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.

        <plot>Command &amp; Conquer developed ideas from Westwood&apos;s previous Dune 2, forming a real time strategy
            game which has influenced many. The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them
            is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation.&amp;#xA;The game focuses on a war between two
            organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side
            for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light
            infantry.&amp;#xA;In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most
            important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it&apos;s
            converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.&amp;#xA;The game also features FMV
            mission briefings and victory cutscenes.

            Rare platformers including Banjo-Kazooie, with a twist.&amp;#xA;In this case, Conker has had one hell of a

            right. So it&apos;s up to Conker and his many skills to clean things up.&amp;#xA;Conker goes through plenty
            of wild and wacky levels, most of which are based on classic movies including The Matrix, Jaws, Aliens, The
            Terminator and even Eyes Wide Shut. A multiplayer mode is also included, allowing 4 players to battle it out
            in many different styles of multiplayer gameplay.

            race against the computer or up to three other opponents in a wide variety of cars and locales. Game

            sportcars to more esoteric cars like trucks, minis, and police vehicles. Tracks model real life (Alaska,
            India, Korea, etc.) and eventually branch out into fantasy worlds (Atlantis, Amazon, Mars).

            USA thrilled racers with a scenic trip across the highways of America, but this time the action will take
            you all around the world. Each track is packed full of realistic scenery and authentic landmarks, so playing
            this game could save you a lot of dough on travel expenses. You can catch a glimpse of the Sphinx, the
            Statue of Liberty, and the Mayan ruins without leaving the security of your living room couch.&amp;#xA; If
            you&apos;re looking for a realistic racing simulation with real world physics, then this is definitely not
            the game for you. The graphics are realistic, but the actual game play is twisted to the extreme. Even
            though blazing across the Great Wall of China may be unbelievable, it certainly is fun. You can leap-frog
            over a semi truck with a police car, or perform a back flip with a military ATV. Add to this a bonus race
            that takes place on the moon, and you have a good idea of Midway&apos;s over-the-top execution of the Cruis&apos;n
            concept.&amp;#xA;Many of us will never get the chance to visit the Egyptian pyramids, let alone the
            opportunity to drive a screaming ambulance straight through them. Cruis&apos;n World provides fun fantasy
            racing action, and the best thing about it is that you won&apos;t have to worry about your luggage getting
            left behind in Russia.

            Bumper Badger, Banjo (prior to meeting Kazooie in Banjo-Kazooie), pre-sweary Conker, Tiptup Turtle, and
            Pipsy Mouse.&amp;#xA;Diddy Kong Racing is a racing game with similarities to Mario Kart 64, in that you race

            hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the &quot;Silver Coin Challenge&quot;. In this

            courses (some in alternate paths).&amp;#xA;The game also features a strategic method of using weapons. Each
            colored balloon on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple
            times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times). This gives the player the choice of snatching
            every balloon available and using it immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful
            version of it later.&amp;#xA;Up to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks,
            they must first be unlocked in the single player game. There are also four battle modes of play - two
            standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in
            your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest (with

            cracks that have made Duke famous. There are also some jokes hidden away based on classic movies (Clockwork
            Orange, 12 Monkeys, Mars Attacks and Apocalypse Now).&amp;#xA;However, there have been plenty of
            restrictions in this version of Duke 3D. Nintendo have replaced some areas (the porn mag shop has turned
            into a gun store, the bar is now a burger joint, and the nude women aren&apos;t nude anymore), and there is
            an option available to turn the blood off.&amp;#xA;A 4 player mode has also been included, where you can
            take on your mates as well as Duke Bots, and a 2 player co-op mode, so two players can tackle the single
            player missions.

        <plot>Famed SNES racer F-Zero got this N64 update. Gameplay remains essentially unchanged, race in a futuristic
            racing tournament on tracks levitated miles up in the air, against a selection of devious opponents.&amp;#xA;Where
            the original had 4 cars to choose from and race against, F-Zero X has no fewer than 30 vehicles all with
            their own unique strengths and weaknesses, a choice of colours, and customisable power/acceleration ratios
            for each track. At the beginning you are limited to choosing from 6 cars and 3 tournaments (each featuring 6
            tracks each), but in true Nintendo fashion, more cars and tracks are unlocked as you progress through the
            game. As well as the cups, you can also race in time trial mode, against a &apos;ghost car&apos; recording
            of your best previous lap, a lÃ¡ Mario Kart 64.&amp;#xA;Gone are the entirely flat tracks of the original,
            having been replaced with tracks that twist, turn, loop, rotate and basically contort into the most crazy
            shapes you could imagine. One unique feature amongst almost all other racing games is the &quot;X&quot;
            tournament, where courses are totally randomly generated each time you start.&amp;#xA;One of the most
            important changes to the format is the inclusion of multiplayer support for up to 4 players. The various
            combat moves are especially important against aggressive human play.&amp;#xA;This game has a rock
            soundtrack, which I believe is the first game soundtrack ever to feature the bestial grunting found only in
            death metal music.

            up in which you have complete movement freedom in 3 dimensions, as you accelerate, swerve and strafe your

            hazards. Be very aware of other craft out to take all you have, as they alter their approach based on your
            weaponry (from the 25 featured in the game) and past encounters.&amp;#xA;On the PC, multiplayer action can
            feature up to 12 human players. The Nintendo 64 version featured 4 player split-screen multiplayer, while
            the Playstation version has no multiplayer options.

            innovations like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major
            changes this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The
            characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage. Each one has four unique weapons and different levels
            of speed and armor.&amp;#xA;The hub system steps away from the traditional &quot;single levels stringed
            along into episodes&quot; system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made
            popular by Wolfenstein 3D. In Hexen&apos;s hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected
            levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single &quot;hub&quot; level through portals. There are
            also portals between some of the &quot;spoke&quot; levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back
            and forth between different levels.&amp;#xA;Other innovations in Hexen included weather effects, jumping,

        <plot>In-Fisherman Bass Hunter 64 is a bass fishing simulation game for the Nintendo 64. The game offers three
            playing modes: fish for fun, championship, and Custom Tournament. The first lets you choose a lake and fish
            there at your leisure. The second adds a competitive element. You pick one of two characters and participate
            in contests, where you have to catch a certain number of bass within a time limit. You start with simple
            gear, but every time you end up in the top 3 you gain points with which you can upgrade you gear (rods,
            boats, bait).

        <plot>The year is 1947. Dr. Jones Jr is on a retirement from adventuring, living the life of a scholar and an
            archaeologist. But soon he meets his old flame ...and new enemies. Soviets are tracking parts of a
            mysterious, powerful machine from ancient Babylon, hoping to use it as a weapon. They must be stopped from
            unleashing unspeakable danger from another world.&amp;#xA;Are you ready to lead Indy into adventures in lost
            temples, under mountains and through unexplored mines, for tales of missing artifacts, snake encounters and
            other things?&amp;#xA;Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine combined action and adventure in a way the
            older Indy games did not do. The gameplay is inspired by Tomb Raider, as Indy moves through 3D
            representations of 17 locations around the world. The game engine is modified from Jedi Knight.&amp;#xA;Puzzles
            based around switches &amp; items; precise jumping must be negotiated on regular basis. You must use
            ladders, ropes and dinghies as well as moving on foot. You will also find yourself aboard a jeep and a mine
            cart. Replacements for your standard whip can be collected en route (from Soviet army arsenal), including
            grenades, sub-machine guns and bazookas. The valuable treasures you find can be used to buy extra ammo
            (between the levels). After each level you get your score (Indy Quotient) - you must reach all the treasure
            items cleverly hidden in secret places to get all the points.

            They&apos;ll have to stop along multiple planets along the way, and assisting King Jeff and rescuing his
            subjects, the Tribals.&amp;#xA;Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter which revels in making gigantic
            creepy bugs explode into dribbly mucousy bits. The Jet Force team are given progressively more powerful
            weapons, from the Machine Gun, which rips through both enemies and ammo, the Plasma Shotgun, which you can
            charge up for some explosive fireworks, and the Tri-Rocket Launcher, which fires three rockets with every
            shot, sending explosive doom in the direction of your target. There&apos;s also the Fish Food, which is used
            to...er, feed fish. Really.&amp;#xA;Even though they&apos;re called Drones, these bugs aren&apos;t stupid.
            When encountered, they&apos;ll rush you, hide behind objects for cover, and even run off for reinforcements
            when you confront them. They also take delight in shooting the innocent Tribals, whom you are supposed to be
            rescuing. But the Drones are nothing compared to the game&apos;s insanely difficult bosses, which includes a
            pair of gigantic praying mantis, a huge beetle, and of course, Mizar himself, to name but a few.&amp;#xA;Each
            of their team has their own special abilities - Juno can walk through lava without any trouble, Vela can
            swim underwater, and Lupus can hover for short distances and travel through tight spaces. These abilities
            are required to fully access areas that they previously couldn&apos;t reach. The team also get the help of
            Floyd the Droid, a hovering robot that can be controlled by player two as a floating gun with infinite ammo
            when he joins your team.&amp;#xA;The game also includes three different multiplayer modes: Battle -

            - a shooting gallery with a first-person view, and Racing, which includes some kart-like racing as well as

        <plot>For the first time, The Legend of Zelda makes its way to the N64, in fine fashion. Our hero Link is once
            again called for to save the Kingdom of Hyrule, and this time he has a time travel device called the Ocarina
            to help him in his quest.&amp;#xA;Ganon is once again up to his old tricks, and Princess Zelda, as well as
            the Great Deku Tree ask for Links help. To guide him, a young fairy called Navi shows him the tricks of the
            trade. You begin the adventure with the task of collecting your sword and shield, and then saving the Deku
            Tree from the evil that has attacked. From there, you travel to Hyrule, and the many worlds that stem from
            Hyrule Field.&amp;#xA;There are many, many new things in this Zelda compared to past versions, including the
            use of time travel and the two different Links on each side (young Link, who you start the adventure with,
            and teen Link, who you must turn into to complete certain areas of the game). Weapons are also a key
            feature, with bombs, swords and other nifty gadgets available to help you in your quest.

            Runner through each of the levels, dodging defensive blocks and enemies by either placing bombs and blowing
            holes in the ground to finding another way around. By finding all of the gold on the level, you can then

            characters from all over the world equipped with swords, daggers, maces, katanas and other weapons. Basic
            moves include: a quick and a strong attack with weapons, kicks, sidesteps, and throws. Additional attacks
            can be performed by pressing the standard attack buttons in different positions or combined with directional
            buttons. Counter attacks are also possible, but require more complicated button combinations and good
            timing. Standard moves can be linked to combos and each character has a number of individual special moves
            that require specific button combinations to be used.&amp;#xA;Battle arenas feature multiple levels and
            usually contain hazards like acid pools or swinging axes that deal damage when touched. Some arenas also
            contain interactive objects like plant pots or torches that can be thrown at opponents.&amp;#xA;The game is
            fairly bloody (the gore can be turned off in the options menu) and all characters have their own finishing
            moves&amp;#xA;(called executions) - particularly brutal ways of killing an opponent.

            Bowser hasn&apos;t been causing too much trouble, so Mario and his friends have decided to take a trip to
            the golf course. Waialae Country Club wouldn&apos;t allow a couple of underdressed plumbers to become

            and Princess Peach. Each golfer has an individual set of strengths and weaknesses. A highlight of Mario Golf
            64 is a special &quot;Time Attack Mode,&quot; where players must compete to finish a round of golf as
            quickly as possible.&amp;#xA;Mario Golf 64 features an impressive line-up of six courses, which means you&apos;ll
            have to master a total of 108 holes. An optional &quot;Club Handicap Mode&quot; ensures that you stay close
            to the competition, so Luigi won&apos;t get too frustrated if he falls behind. Even though the golfers are
            cartoons, the physics are as realistic as possible. The CPU calculates the exact ball movement based on wind
            direction, the strength of the strike, and any spin you may choose to place on the ball.

        <plot>Mario Kart 64 races eight familiar faces, including Mario, Bowser and Yoshi, on four progressively tougher
            four-track circuits. Wide curves and gentle banks mark the Mushroom Cup tracks. Your commute gets notably
            tougher on the Flower Cup, though. The player will have to dodge semis rumbling on Toad&apos;s Turnpike and
            bounding boulders on fogbound Choco Mountain! Star Cup tracks range from the icy surfaces of Sherbet Land to
            the lava lakes of Bowser&apos;s Castle. The true test of karting competence, though, comes on the four
            tracks in Special Cup. Zip through the dark caves and green hillsides of Donkey Kong&apos;s Jungle Parkway,
            cling to the sheer cliffs of Yoshi Valley and hustle over haunted Banshee Boardwalk before tackling the
            longest track in the game: neon-lit Rainbow Road.&amp;#xA;The game offers two camera angles and three engine
            sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can gain even more speed by mastering the power slide technique or
            grabbing Super Star power-ups. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities.
            Light karts like Princess&apos;s smoothly steer through tight corners, but run the constant risk of getting
            flattened by heavy karts, like Donkey Kong&apos;s. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make
            them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game&apos;s
            unique power-ups.

            didn&apos;t realize that Mario is the biggest party animal on the face of the Earth. Nintendo is throwing
            the most insane bash to ever hit the N64, and you&apos;re invited. For the first time, you&apos;ll catch a
            glimpse of how Mario celebrates all of the victories he&apos;s had over the years.&amp;#xA;Mario Party is
            unlike any other game for the N64, and it just might be the best party game to ever hit the system. Mario
            Party is designed for 1 to 4 players, but it&apos;s not really a party unless you&apos;re playing with your
            pals. The festivities are based on a board game format, right down to the fact that players must roll a die
            to determine how many spaces to move. The fun starts when players land on different squares, because each
            space holds one of more than fifty different mini-games. These quick competitions determine who will earn
            coins and stars, and who will go home empty handed.&amp;#xA; The mini-games are spread over eight different
            game boards, all of which are not immediately available. Some of the games pit every man or princess against
            the others, some are two-on-two, and others are even three against one. The games are simple, but remarkably
            fun to play. One challenge is loosely based on &quot;Simon Says,&quot; another involves a two-on-two bobsled
            race, and one crazy game makes one player attempt to cross a rope while the other three do their best to
            shake the player off. You&apos;ll find skill games, racing games, puzzle games --basically any type of
            challenge you could imagine.&amp;#xA;A good portion of the actual game boards are animated, with hidden
            dangers and special challenges scattered everywhere. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Donkey Kong, Bowser,
            Yoshi, and Wario are all invited to the party, and each character has his or her own game board.&amp;#xA;Mario
            Party is fun for only one player, but to get the most out of this party-in-a-pak, you should play with three
            other friends. It&apos;s definitely the kind of game that will keep you up till the wee hours of the
            morning, so you might want to start catching up on your sleep right away.

        <plot>In a world covered almost entirely in water, there exist small islands that hide huge treasures. And where
            there&apos;s treasure, you can find treasure hunters called Diggers, who live for the thrill of the hunt...&amp;#xA;Barrel
            Casket was once one of the greatest Diggers, but he has now retired. He now cares for his young
            granddaughter, Roll, whose parents disappeared while on a dig. He had also discovered a strange baby boy in
            some ruins one time, who he also took under his care alongside Roll. He named the baby boy Rock Voulnut, and
            Rock grew up to be an expert Digger, sometimes known by his nickname, MegaMan.&amp;#xA;While out exploring
            one day, Rock, Roll, and Barrel&apos;s airship, the Flutter, crash lands on an island named Kattelox. As
            they explore Kattelox in hopes of fixing their ship, they hear word of a huge treasure, the legendary Mother
            Lode, that is buried somewhere on the island. Rock, Roll, and Barrel decide to look for the treasure, but at
            the same time, they&apos;re going to get a little competition from a pirate family named the Bonnes...&amp;#xA;Mega
            Man Legends is the first of the Mega Man series to take place in fully explorable 3D, and is paced more like
            an RPG than the previous stage-to-stage action games. Rock can explore the town and follow the story to find
            entrances to the underground ruins, where in he will find traps, feral Reaverbots, and large boss robots.
            Destroying enemies will reward Rock with health, sub-weapon energy, and the power cores of the robots, which
            people in his world use as currency. By searching through the town and ruins Rock will find items of dubious
            use and value, and they can be brought back to Roll to be assembled into useful items and upgradable
            sub-weapons, although not for free. Rock can run while shooting, go into first person mode for aimed shots,
            and also lock onto an enemy and circle around them to avoid their attacks.

            Speedway USA is a kart racer from Rare based on the Diddy Kong Racing game engine. Players compete in
            circuits of four races, grand prix style, and the player with the most points at the end of all four races
            wins the gold trophy. There are six initial racers, but only three sets of stats shared between them. Minnie
            and Daisy are lightweight and good for beginners, Mickey and Donald are both all-around characters, while
            Pete and Goofy are the slow but fast heavyweights.&amp;#xA;The game has an assortment of pickups - there&apos;s
            the Carbo Spritzer, a soda-powered turbo; the Paint Splotcher, which launches a slippery blob of paint onto
            the track; the Baseball Chucker, which launches an explosive baseball onto the track; and the Magno Flyer,
            which sends a remote control plane to seek the nearest opponent, to name a few. There are also &apos;Oomph
            Tokens&apos; scattered on the track - the first ten of these tokens increase your racer&apos;s maximum speed
            a little.&amp;#xA;As well as the main game, Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA also features a Time Trial mode
            (where you race against the clock), a Practice mode (where you can drive all around a farmyard course to
            practice your skills), and Contest mode (which functions like the famous Battle Mode in Mario Kart 64 -
            players must pop their opponents&apos; three balloons before they lose all of their own). The game is also
            Transfer Pak compatible with the Game Boy Color version of Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA.

        <plot>In a surprising twist of fate, Midway made a Mortal Kombat game that focuses on perhaps the series
            strongest point when compared to other fighting games: it&apos;s storyline. The game casts you in the shoes
            of Sub-Zero, and chronicles a series of events that ocurred prior to Mortal Kombat 1.&amp;#xA;In a storyline
            that is reminiscent of Looking Glass&apos;s Thief, the Lin Kuei assassin/thief is sent to steal an important
            document; this mission proves to be a test from a mysterious character (which turns out to be MK4&apos;s
            Quan Chi) and who charges you upon retrieval of this object to recover an ancient medallion of untold power.
            However once you retrieve the medallion, Quan Chi reveals that he actually tricked you, and the medallion is
            the key to awakening the demonic Shinnok (yup, the same baddie from MK4). You must now become a reluctant
            hero, as you pursue Quan Chi trough hell itself hoping you get to Shinnok before him.&amp;#xA;Gameplay wise
            the game takes the Mortal Kombat familiar 2D fighting enviroment and turns it into a hybrid
            fighter/platformer game, where you must travel trough hazardous levels running and jumping around as well as
            fighting your way against both digitized and polygonal enemies. Sub-Zero&apos;s interface is the same as in
            every MK game, with the addition of a &amp;quot;use&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;turn around&amp;quot; buttons
            and additions such as an inventory, and a slight rpg twist in which you get exp. for defeating opponents,
            which translates into new techniques and moves to execute in the game.&amp;#xA;Technically speaking this
            game represents the final evolutionary step in the MK&apos;s series 2D engines. New features include
            zooming, 3d lighting as well as 3d backgrounds and characters, etc.

            relying on Goemon to save the day, but he hasn&apos;t even noticed what&apos;s happening! Can our hero stop
            the Shoguns before they do any more damage?&amp;#xA;Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon is an action-based RPG
            similar in style to The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. It is also the first localized Goemon game
            since The Legend of the Mystical Ninja for the SNES. Players control Goemon and his friends as they make
            their way through Ancient Japan to stop the Peach Mountain Shoguns. You can talk to characters, whack
            enemies with your pipe (or hurl coins at them), visit a deranged fortune teller who shrieks out &quot;PLASMA!&quot;
            at random intervals for no reason, and more.&amp;#xA;Each member of the Goemon team can also learn a special
            ability to access new areas as players progress through the game. Goemon earns the &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;
            power, which lets him move blocks he normally couldn&apos;t, Ebisumaru can shrink to small sizes so he can
            pass through tiny cracks, Sasuke earns an extra high jump, and Yae gets the ability to transform into a
            Mermaid so that she can swim underwater.&amp;#xA;As usual, the gigantic roller-skating robot, Impact, makes
            an appearance. Players get to use him to trample down buildings and duke it out in first-person mode against
            gigantic mecha boss characters in a Punch-Out!! style game.

            inclined happy. However, the teams features are not entirely based on real life (Indy was at the top), and
            it is not as addictive as the old-fashioned PC games of the early 1990&apos;s, but still a good game for
            someone who doesn&apos;t mind not-so-classic, almost XFL style football.

        <plot>After the award-winning NHL 98, EA worked to improve what was considered to be one the most complete ice
            hockey games in the market. Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode
            first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size.&amp;#xA;Graphically,
            the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and
            stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the
            ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an
            higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game.&amp;#xA;As graphic changes aren&apos;t
            enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in
            offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles
            to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new
            special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves Jagr, Fedorov and SelÃ¤nne pull when one-on-one
            with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the
            play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a &quot;Brett Hull&quot;.
            For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to
            concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent.&amp;#xA;The season mode was also improved, with the
            players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville
            Predators, players can either choose to play with their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft.&amp;#xA;Like
            in the previous year, Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh liven up matches with play by play and colour
            commentary.

            modes, Race Series and Time Trial, and a mode that allows you to create your own track. The game also
            supports up to four human players.&amp;#xA;In Race Series you can select one of the thirteen cars and race
            in any of the nine tracks with five more competitors. You can only compete in Class C (lower difficulty)
            races at first but can unlock more if you finish within the first three positions. At the beginning of each
            race you are given the option to customize your car&apos;s parts - parts like the car&apos;s body, engine,
            tires, etc. - but only if you have more than one in stock for each category. New parts can be taken from the

            line. Also, each part has points and the sum of these points must not exceed the point limit for each
            difficulty. For example a basic brake part may add one point to the total sum (better parts add more
            points). If with all the other parts the sum of points exceeds a lets say point limit of six then you are
            not allowed to enter the race. The current mode supports up to two human players.&amp;#xA;Time Trial is the
            basic mode where you run against time. You can also load a previously saved ghost to race against.&amp;#xA;VS
            Race mode can be accessed only if three or four human players are selected. It has 8 tracks that are

        <plot>An enemy with the codename &quot;Quake&quot;, which is believed to come from another dimension, is using
            teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base
            only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter
            to Quake&apos;s realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of
            monsters, and exact revenge.&amp;#xA;id Software&apos;s followup to Doom and Doom II, &quot;Quake&quot; is a
            first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels
            themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and
            character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have
            an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.&amp;#xA;In
            single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct
            episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to
            a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id&apos;s
            earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.&amp;#xA;Unlike Doom&apos;s
            rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake&apos;s
            levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military
            base (with a technological &apos;slipgate&apos; as the level exit), later levels take place in environments
            inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through
            magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom&apos;s colorful environments, all Quake levels are
            dominated by earth colors.&amp;#xA;The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents
            armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights,
            ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The
            player&apos;s weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel. Besides a (bloodstained) axe,
            there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical
            energy.&amp;#xA;Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs.
            The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode.
            One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and
            skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game
            also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.

            stole the pack along with the last two crayons! He drew a mischievous-looking character, who came to life
            and said &quot;Let&apos;s cause trouble!&quot; Twinkle Town was terrified of the bully and his crayon

            is a 2D fighting game, similar to Marvel Vs. Capcom. You select from a variety of hand-drawn cartoon
            characters, and fight using low, middle and high punches and kicks. As you&apos;d expect with this type of
            game, special button combinations yield special, more powerful moves. There is also a &apos;crayon meter&apos;
            that fills the more you attack your opponent - when it is completely filled, you can pull off a devastating
            special move.&amp;#xA;The kids&apos; characters are a lively bunch, full of an assortment of crazy moves.
            There&apos;s Robot C.H.O., who is a robot that turns into different metal objects on the fly, such as a car,
            garbage can, rocket, and more. There&apos;s BearTank, which is a green teddy bear with gun turrets on it.
            Captain.Cat.Kit is a DJ cat with slick basketball moves who also attacks with a variety of musical
            instruments.&amp;#xA;An interesting feature of Rakugakids is that Story Mode can be played by using &quot;Training
            Mode&quot;. In this mode, you select a character, and train them up by playing matches against any character
            you like. It is beneficial to train more, because you can choose to play Story Mode in &apos;Battle Mode&apos;.
            This mode automatically plays the game for you using your trained up character. If you&apos;ve trained
            enough, your character will react to opponent attacks in the same way that you yourself would.

        <plot>Rally Championship 2000 is a racing game for the N64 and features 9 courses in different countries around
            the world, licensed cars including Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Toyota Corolla, etc. and
            with each car having its own strengths and weaknesses, car damage, various weather conditions and 4 modes.&amp;#xA;1.
            Arcade - you must simply select one of the 3 difficulty settings, one of the available cars and compete with
            the other 8 CPU players for the first place. Each difficulty setting has 3 races and the place you manage to
            get at the end of each race is carried on to the next one. Car damage does not apply in this mode.&amp;#xA;2.
            Championship - you race in a total of 9 rounds with 3 laps per round. In each round you get points depending
            on what position you finished in and in the end these points are accumulated to decide your final ranking.
            In this mode you can see the damage inflicted on the car, not on the car itself but on an icon on the left
            part of the screen. Effects from the damage include lesser top speed, slower acceleration and bad steering.
            It is also possible to customize certain options like tires, steering, etc., to get the best possible
            performance depending on the weather condition on each course.&amp;#xA;3. Practice - mode where you can
            learn the controls and get acquainted with the various courses of the game.&amp;#xA;4. Vs Race - allows up
            to 4 players to play simultaneously in any of the game&apos;s courses.

        <plot>Rampage World Tour is a updated version of the classic Rampage. Rampage World Tour starts off at Scumlabs
            International where three lab technicians, George, Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an accident involving
            toxic waste. George has turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some sort
            of gigantic wolf. The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and then embark on a path of
            destruction encompassing the entire globe.&amp;#xA;The player chooses one of these three characters and
            begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks. The
            ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities where they are located.
            Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way. Scumlabs
            and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play
            simultaneously.&amp;#xA;The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful &quot;cartoon&quot;
            flavor. Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to
            destroy them. Once all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and
            players proceed to the next stage. Players can get many different kinds of power-ups that make them more
            powerful or restore health.

            very much in tune with its history, barely deviating from the original city-stomping arcade game appearing
            in the 1980s. Like its predecessor, Rampage World Tour, Rampage 2 retains the original 2D worlds, but
            improves the graphics, completely re-rendering the characters. The premise remains the same: stomp out
            cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include four new characters (in addition
            to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds. The cart allows up to three
            people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to destroy.

            a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a &quot;reversed&quot; (backwards) or &quot;mirror&quot;
            (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from.&amp;#xA;There
            are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There&apos;s a Single Race, where you
            complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where

            power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles
            to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which

            human players that can compete in any of the available circuits with 4 more CPU controlled racers. The mode
            allows for either vertical or horizontal split screen.&amp;#xA;Quick Race - In Quick Race the player can

            Trial - Like Quick Race mode, the player can also select here the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions

            (like parachutes or snow-men) against other snowboard kids in order to slow them down. There are great
            power-ups during the gameplay. Courses are rarely covered with snow - most of the races are held in freakish

            Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. And none too soon, because
            the Invaders are back!&amp;#xA;Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision. (See
            Battlezone and Asteroids.) But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari. The game
            stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.&amp;#xA;You can play either one or two
            players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill
            levels. You&apos;ll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and
            finally Earth. There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common
            ones. You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row. As in
            the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit
            them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots. Plus, after fighting off several
            waves on each planet, you&apos;ll face a unique boss. If you manage to finish the game, you&apos;ll be able
            to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.

            no-where, many years after its first launch, and is on a collision course with Earth. Two unlikely heroes
            (pilot and all-round ugly looking guy Dan and robot Evo) are now thrust with the mission to stop the

            smashed into pieces. His only hope for survival is to attach his microchip into another host robot.
            Thankfully, underneath the wrecked ship is the remains of another robot, and with a quick fix Evo is now a

            Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character
            designs.&amp;#xA;Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius&apos;s new
            invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device. Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover
            the sinister motives behind the device&apos;s theft.&amp;#xA;This game features appearances not only by most
            major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the
            Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America.&amp;#xA;Spider-Man&apos;s webs are greatly emphasized.
            He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive
            combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective
            shield. His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out. The
            wall-crawling powers are also prominently features. Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling. This is
            used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the
            heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.&amp;#xA;Combat is based around
            Spider-Man&apos;s ability to jump, kick, punch and web. By combining these with direction and in various
            combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee
            range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things. There are a number of boss-battles as well,
            all of which are puzzle-based.&amp;#xA;Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or
            find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the
            police.&amp;#xA;There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable
            Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.

            throughout the level, and finding all of them will unlock a cheat dependent on which difficulty setting the

        <plot>Tony Hawk&apos;s Pro Skater is a skateboarding simulation in which you control a famous skate star around
            3D environments. Each game area contains a plethora of objects like ramps, rails, and half-pipes which can
            be used to perform tricks. Each trick you perform earns you more points for your score.&amp;#xA;The game is
            divided into two types of levels. In the first, you skate around locations like a mall, a city street, or a
            warehouse. In each of these areas, there are 5 goals for the you to complete. Some goals involve obtaining a
            high score, others smashing objects, and some collecting objects. For every goal you complete, you earn a
            video tape. By collecting enough video tapes, you unlock levels and skateboards for you to use. There are 6
            levels like this. The second type of level is a competition. You get to make 3 timed runs through a skate
            park, and attempt to get the highest score possible. If you do well enough, you will beat the scores of the
            computer controlled skaters and win a medal. There are 3 levels like this.&amp;#xA;There are nine real life
            pro skaters you can choose to play as, including Tony Hawk himself. Each skater has their own signature
            moves that earn you big points if pulled off successfully.

            Turok throws the Chronocepter into a waiting volcano to destroy it. Unfortunately the blast awakens an even
            deadlier force - The Primagen - who lays in wait for his freedom from a wrecked space craft, buried at the
            core of the Lost Land. Once again a Turok is tasked with restoring peace to the land and stopping the
            Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world.&amp;#xA;The game features an armory twice as large as its
            predecessor, and many weapons will even have a later update that makes them even more devastating. New
            weapons include the lethal discus Razor Wind, a proximity mine layer, and the Cerebral Bore, a flying
            grenade that homes in on an enemy&apos;s head, drills through their skull, and then explodes. Enemies have
            damage models now, allowing limbs to be torn off or bloody holes to be blasted through torsos. Turok won&apos;t
            be facing any human opponents this time, but will find himself under attack by plenty of dinosaur/human
            hybrids, brutish giants, and man-sized insectoids.&amp;#xA;The goal of each level is to reach the end and
            defend one of the five totems that keeps the Primagen captive in its ship as well as finding keys to unlock
            the portals that lead to later levels. In each level Turok can also find a special spiritual power, such as
            immunity to lava or a long jump. After finding a power, he will need to return to an earlier level to use
            that power to find one of the five keys that opens the portal to the Primagen itself. While searching for
            spiritual powers Turok will occasionally find portals that transport him to a strange place full of deadly
            creatures who appear to be unaffiliated with the Primagen, but discovering their true purpose is the job for
            another Turok.&amp;#xA;A multiplayer game is included as well, with options for between 2 and 4 players and
            game-types like deathmatch and capture-the-flag. This multiplayer mode would later be expanded into a full
            game with Turok: Rage Wars.

            Joseph. Each has unique paths through the same levels, as Joseph&apos;s small size allows him to fit into
            air ducts to take the low road, while Danielle&apos;s magnetic grappling hook allows her to take the high
            road. Each also has unique upgrades to basic weapons. While Danielle&apos;s shotgun upgrade coats the

            landscapes add new excitement to the game. There are 18 charcters with storylines to walk through, which in

            world-wide oil shortage in 1976. OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the shortage,
            except in the U.S. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy: Sid Burn. His job, aided by 5
            hired Coyotes, is to destroy all gas refineries in the southwest of the U.S. so OMAR can bring the U.S. to
            its knees. Then later, when gas prices went wild, 6 civilians by the name of Vigilantes, lead by the truck
            driver Convoy, fight against the Coyotes in different areas to keep OMAR from succeeding.&amp;#xA;Choose
            from 8 characters with different endings with cars&amp;#xA;ranging to classic 70&apos;s muscle cars to a
            school bus, each stacked high with all sorts of weapons. Lots of unlockables include 2 hidden levels (3
            hidden levels in the N64 version) and 5 hidden characters and cars. Multiplayer, of course, is where it&apos;s
            at. The PSX version allows 2 players, while the N64 title allows 4 to go head-to-head.

        <plot>The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands
            on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17&apos;s
            WORMNET.&amp;#xA;For those who&apos;ve never played Worms, it&apos;s at heart similar to the old game
            Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and
            try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a
            team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to
            dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep.&amp;#xA;Everything is presented in a
            humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or
            despair, depending on how you do.&amp;#xA;Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and
            while an improvement over Worms 2, it&apos;s not a huge change.

        <plot>WWF Attitude was the third wrestling game by Acclaim for the Sony Playstation. It was also the second WWF
            3D wrestling game for the system. This game was the followup to the commercial success WWF War Zone. At the
            time it was the wrestling game to have featured the most modes. The 20 or so game modes included specialty
            matches like royal rumble, survivor series, tornado matches and more. Also featured was a new career mode
            compared to that of WWF War Zone, realistic entrances and a first ever Create a PPV mode. The game featured
            over 40 of the then current WWF Superstars, including hidden ones. The Create A Wrestler feature was one of
            the most advanced of it&apos;s time.

        <plot>One of the first wrestling games for the Nintendo 64, and one of the many for the Playstation. The
            Playstation version has better, CD quality music, but has less features. One of the main attractions was
            that WWF&apos;s Steve Austin did a lot of voice acting for it, although the other wrestlers don&apos;t have
            nearly as much speech.&amp;#xA;Features include custom player made wrestlers, as well as the real wrestlers,
            many different game types (single player, multiplayer, royal rumbles, cage matches, etc.), but the career
            mode is where the action is, and you can build up your wrestlers strengths, and earn him belts.

        <plot>WWF Wrestlemania 2000 is THQ&apos;s first WWF licenced game after making two previous WCW titles.
            Wrestlemania 2K picks up where WCW/NWO Revenge left off. The graphics are by far superior as well is the
            animation. Wrestlemania 2K adds three highly sort after features: Cage match, custom entrances and Create A
            Wrestler feature.&amp;#xA;Wrestlemania 2K features more than 50 real WWF stars as well as the option for 16
            custom wrestlers. All the wrestlers come with their real-life theme music, entrance videos (made into slide
            shows) and entrance performances. A great improvement over the previous game is the &quot;road to
            Wrestlemania&quot; mode, an enhanced tournament where players can challenge for any number of belts and be
            challenged by other wrestlers in a 12 month journey that finally leads to Wrestlemania 2000 itself.

        <plot>Xena: Warrior Princess - Talisman of Fate is based on the TV-series Xena: Warrior Princess. The Nintendo
            64 version of the series tie-in is a fighting game, unlike its PlayStation counterpart.&amp;#xA;The whole
            Xena universe is used in the game as all the levels and characters, except the new boss character, are
            familiar to the fans of the show. The action takes place in arenas which represent different kinds of
            surroundings with all the characters having their &quot;own&quot; level.&amp;#xA;The fighting is done with
            various weapons each character wielding his/her trademark weapon such as Xena&apos;s chakram, Gabrielle&apos;s
            staff and Callisto&apos;s sword. It includes most of the standard fighting-game modes such as story, vs. and
            training as well as a roster mode, where each player picks a succession of characters rather than just one.&amp;#xA;The
            fighting system is somewhat different from more traditional games. The most obvious difference is that four
            players are allowed instead of two. It can be a team battle or a free-for-all. The analog stick moves
            characters around on the ground in two dimensions, with separate buttons for block, jump and duck. The
            C-buttons handle attacks. Special moves are accomplished mostly by pulling the analog stick either toward
            your opponent, then away or vice-versa.

        <plot>Loosely based on the Super NES classic Yoshi&apos;s Island, Yoshi&apos;s Story follows the adventures of
            six Yoshis as they search through sunny woods, dark caves, soaring mountains, steaming jungles, vast oceans,
            and gloomy castles for the Super Happy Tree, which has been stolen by the dreaded Baby Bowser. Yoshi can
            walk, run, swim, leap, flutter, and fire his payload of eggs. The action takes place in storybook &quot;pages&quot;
            made up of bookmaking materials and other familiar textures, including cut-paper forests, denim clouds,
            inflatable plastic islands, and stacks of colored spools.&amp;#xA;Yoshi&apos;s Story pioneers use of the
            Rumble Pak as a key element of the game-play experience, as you&apos;ll be able to feel invisible but
            treacherous currents when Yoshi swims through oceanic depths. The Rumble Pak can also help you locate hidden
            fruit or other objects by rumbling when Yoshi smells something. With a light touch of the Control Stick you
            can float on a leaf, ride a friendly dragon, and tiptoe past a swarm of angry bees.
