        <plot>This is an enhanced version of 1942: The Pacific Air War, with most of the graphics and sounds reworked.
            There are also changes in the weapons and the inclusion of anachronical items such as laser-firing WWII
            planes and ships that run on ground. The player controls a biplane Boeing Stearman E75 N68828 instead of the
            P-38.&amp;#xA;The PC Engine adaptation adds some original levels to those from the arcade version, as well
            as animated intermissions.

            really made a big impact in the west. Four players (any combination of human and computer) take it in turns
            to roll dice and move around the isometric board, landing on various event squares. The ultimate aim is to
            build as many hotels as you can and make more loot than your opponents.

        <plot>Wonder Boy III: The Dragon&apos;s Trap is a direct sequel to Wonder Boy in Monster Land. When Tom-Tom
            defeats the MEKA dragon, the wounded beast casts a spell on him, turning him into a Lizard-Man. To regain
            his original human form, he has to find the Salamander Cross, hidden by the Vampire Dragon in Monster Land.
            Unlike its predecessor, this side-scrolling platform game is not divided in sequences of levels. The
            protagonist is allowed to go anywhere, as long as he has the right shape or equipment. During his quest,
            Tom-Tom has to defeat various dragon bosses. Each win will give him a new shape with new abilities such as
            flying, swimming, walking on ceilings or clinging to walls. These abilities also allow the player access new
            parts of the world. The possible shapes are Lizard-Man, Mouse-Man, Piranha-Man, Lion-Man and Hawk-Man and
            the main abilities are defined by attacking power, defense points and charm points (needed for equipment by
            collecting charm stones). Also, certain blocks can only be destroyed by specific weapons or are only
            accessible to certain shapes. The basic actions consist of attacking and jumping, and in the status screen
            it is possible to equip swords, shields and armour. Special attacks include fire balls, tornadoes, arrows,
            boomerangs and thunder strikes. Along the way, the player collects keys (only one at all times) and gold
            left behind by defeated creatures, and places need to be re-visited sometimes to access new areas. Equipment
            and items can be bought in towns. A password is given at the beginning of each town to continue from there.

        <plot>Aoi Blink is a side-scrolling platformer based on the TV anime series of the same name. The five levels
            are similarly built as the ones in Super Mario Bros. 3: they are divided into various areas which are
            reached through a map screen with branching paths. Those areas need to be solved to be able to walk further
            on the map. The speciality of this game is that the player can switch between three characters with
            different abilities on the fly, e.g. one can jump high and another has a better gun. Those are important to
            be able to solve the challenges the levels bring, mostly consisting of traditional platforming and
            avoiding/shooting enemies. However, the boss area at the end of the level map has to be opened with a master
            key. There is one hidden in every area. The three characters are based on characters of the series and
            change depending on the level. The health pool is shared between all characters and losing all hearts
            results in losing a life. Hearts can be refilled by collecting money which is left behind by killed enemies.

        <plot>Chew Man Fu has set a curse to rob the world of fried rice, egg rolls and all its other favourite foods.
            To stop him you must work through 550 rounds, clearing them by placing four different coloured balls into
            the appropriately-coloured hole. Gameplay is something of a Pengo variant, as the single-screen levels are
            inhabited by enemies, who can be killed by firing one of the balls at them at speed. When it hits one it
            will continue moving in the same direction, rebounding off walls if neccessary, and pushing you backwards
            slightly if it comes back to you - but it can be instantaneously brought back under control. Blocks can also
            be moved at a more casual speed, including round corners. Once a block is placed onto its spot, it can be
            used again as a weapon. The levels are in a maze style, and parts of this can be opened up. The game also
            includes a small bonus Kick-Ball game for 2 players, which doubles as practice with the control system.

        <plot>For many years, monsters have been terrorizing the peaceful lands, until finally, the Buddhist priests
            known as the Dharma Eyes found a safe heaven in a secluded temple, where they raised young martial artists
            who would eventually liberate the people from the monsters. One day, one of these disciples was kidnapped by
            monsters and taken into their tower. The current Dharma Eye instructs another disciple, named Oniwaka, to
            venture towards the tower to the south and find a way to rescue his friend... and perhaps finally put an end
            to the monster invasion.&amp;#xA;Benkei Gaiden is a traditional Japanese-style RPG, set in an environment
            reminiscent of Japan of the feudal epoch, with supernatural elements such as monsters etc. The player
            navigates Oniwaka on the top-down map, visiting towns, buying equipment (weapons and armor), and fighting
            randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Obviously, the game
            has been heavily influenced by the early Dragon Quest games; the interaction menu is nearly identical (the
            player has to bring up a menu and choose verb commands such as &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Search&amp;quot;,
            rather than perform different actions simply by pressing a button), and the general gameplay system does not

        <plot>Eleven years have gone by since Tom-Tom rescued his girlfriend Tanya from the clutches of the evil King.
            Word of Tom-Tom&apos;s dangerous adventure soon spread throughout Wonder Land. The people were very proud of
            him and gave Tom-Tom the highest honor of all - the legendary name of Wonder Boy. With the evil King
            defeated, Wonder Land returned to its peaceful state, and for over one decade, the kingdom was a paradise,
            and everything and everyone lived happily together. Eventually, the peace was broken when a ferocious
            fire-breathing dragon appeared out of nowhere and took over Wonder Land with an army of evil, monsterous
            henchmen, causing Wonder Land was immediately thrown into utter chaos. Defenseless that they were, the
            people were quickly taken over and the tranquil and serene kingdom was transformed into a land of demons and
            devils. Wonder Land was now a Monster Land. Tom-Tom was summoned to set out on a journey, destroy this
            dragon, and restore peace once again. Tom-Tom is Wonder Land&apos;s last hope. There are twelve locations in
            which Tom-Tom must venture through, including (but not limited to): the city of Wonder Land, Valley of
            Peace, The Coastal Town of Baraboro, The Mam Desert, and Pororo Islands. During his journey, he must defeat
            monsters with the sword that he got at the beginning of his adventure. These monsters will leave either gold
            coins or bags of cash, which he can use to buy better weapons, shields, armors, and boots. At the end of
            each location, there is usually a boss that Tom-Tom must defeat in order to obtain a gold key that will
            unlock the exit gate, as well as plenty of gold coins or bags of cash. If he touches any enemies, or is shot
            at, he will lose health. During his travels, Tom-Tom must take note of the hourglass; if the hourglass
            display sands at the bottom, he must get another one that appears out of nowhere, or he&apos;ll also lose
            health. There are two ways in which he can restore it. He can either go into bars to have a drink that will
            restore it and get a hint about what lies ahead as well, or go into hospitals and heal himself to restore
            the lost health.

        <plot>Blodia is a puzzle game with similarities to sliding block puzzles. Each level is composed of a number of
            tiles and every one has a part of a pipe (straight or angular) on it - except one which is just a black
            hole. In one tile a red ball starts rolling and all tiles it rolls through become blank. The goal of each
            level is to let the ball roll through all pipe parts without meeting the hole or a blank tile. To ensure
            this, the player can move the parts while using the hole as buffer. So, as example, if the player clicks on
            a tile which is a few tiles away from the hole, all tiles between the clicked tile and the hole are moved by
            one towards the hole. Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on. At the start of a puzzle,
            rolling out of the level boundaries is also deadly, but after a certain amount of tiles are cleared the ball
            comes out at the opposite side of the playfield.

        <plot>Users Battle is a Bomberman game for the PC Engine, released only in Japan. It bears a 1990 copyright,
            just like the original release of Bomberman for the platform. Additionally, it plays the same title screen
            music upon boot, but it has a different title screen, only allowing for multiplayer play for two to five
            players. It lacks the skull mode option of the full Bomberman release, but otherwise shows similar menus and
            styles to Bomberman&apos;s multiplayer mode. It is believed that Users Battle was created in extremely
            limited quantities for use at tournaments, demo kiosks, or both. Some online sources estimate the number of
            cards produced at around 1,000.

            planets again. The objective is the same as in Dyna Blaster: use bombs to destroy all enemies in a level.
            Once you have destroyed them all, find the exit hidden in a block so you can be transported to the next
            level. A block will also flash yellow to let you know that a power-up can be obtained there. Power-ups
            include more bombs, manual detonation, extra lives, and extended flames. Occasionally, you also get the
            ability to walk through bombs or walls, or to kick bombs.&amp;#xA;If you manage to reveal the exit before
            all enemies are destroyed, it remains in an &quot;inactive&quot; state, meaning that you cannot be
            transported to the next level until you blow up all the enemies and therefore making it &quot;active&quot;.
            If you accidentally blow up the exit, whether it is active or not, or if time runs out, you will unleash a
            few enemies that you also need to destroy. After every eighth level, there is a boss that you need to
            destroy to proceed to the next planet.&amp;#xA;Besides this Normal mode, there are two other modes: Battle
            and Versus. In Battle, you can play against four human- or computer-controlled players in one of seven
            stages, each with different features like warp holes, conveyor belts, revolving doors, and much more. In
            Versus, you play head-to-head against a friend using the TurboExpress for non-stop action. Regardless of
            these two modes, you can still obtain power-ups to give out some punishment against your fellow players, and
            the maximum number of wins can be set before play.

            hit both depletes the opponent&apos;s energy bar and gives points. Similar to real boxing, those points are

            bugs. To do this, you have a long pink tongue that shoots out to swallow any critters in your way, you then
            have to spit them out into the gaping maws of hungry plants dotted around the level. But being a lizard, you
            are seemingly unable to jump, so to navigate your way around, you have a tail that shoots upwards to catch
            on to any grippable areas of platform above. And to make things harder, there are certain sections of floor
            that can be slid left or right by pushing up when over the appropriate arrowed block.

        <plot>City Hunter is based on the eponymous manga by Tsukasa Hojo. The story focuses on Ryo Saeba, a young man
            with a mysterious past, who founds the City Hunter team in Shinjuku, Tokyo. The City Hunter is an
            underground private detective agency, which takes care of particularly dangerous cases. In the game, the
            player is able to play through three of such cases, which are unrelated to each other and can be played in
            any order.&amp;#xA;The gameplay is essentially that of a side-scrolling shooter. The player navigates Ryo
            through the stages, dispatching of the frequently appearing enemies with his gun. The gameplay system is
            rather simple, without power-ups or different weapons, and with one items possible to carry at a time. The
            levels are usually designed as vast indoor areas, with many rooms Ryo can enter. The structure of the game
            also reveals mild adventure elements: often it is necessary to speak to a character, receive an item (such
            as a key), back-track to a previous area in order to reach a previously inaccessible room, etc.

            into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for
            double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up &apos;combos&apos;
            - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.&amp;#xA;As well as the normal game
            mode, there is also a &apos;flash&apos; mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from
            the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number

            breaks and a life is lost. Besides flying enemies which are disposed of with the standard gun, the player
            also has to deal with enemies on the ground which need to be hit with one of the unlimited bomb. The player
            has the choice between four insect forms which are changed by collecting the associated extra symbols.
            Collecting more of the same symbol upgrades the insect, but this also rises the difficulty level. Other
            extras include smart bombs, extra lives, armor refreshments or a protection shield. The game features the

            &quot;Module&quot; mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently
            colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed

            system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind &quot;NeoParts&quot;,
            which can be brought back to the Swordfish&apos;s lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances
            statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six
            modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.&amp;#xA;Combat takes
            place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be
            positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry.
            Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of &quot;options&quot; that are consumable
            attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either
            one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair
            kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots

            with a certain amount of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two
            worlds which the area branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach
            the end of the game by.&amp;#xA;Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to
            unimaginative attack waves and little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic
            powerup system, which is nowhere near the complexity of the aforementioned R-Type&apos;s and Gradius&apos;.

            because of Nobita, Doraemon&apos;s best friend and geek extraordinaire. Something went wrong when Nobita was

            gun, but later is able to find other weapons, including a homing bowling ball launcher and a stun gun. He
            can also collect various power-ups, such as limited invincibility, high speed, an item that freezes all the

        <plot>Double Dungeons is a solo dungeon crawler in the strictest sense. One or two players can explore
            pseudo-3D, maze-like dungeons (without auto-map feature, but with directions displayed on the screen) and
            fight the monsters populating them. The player(s) can choose to venture into any of the available 20
            dungeons. The dungeons have the same textures, but their layout varies; the higher is the number of the
            chosen dungeon, the more dangerous are its enemies. Two-player mode features a split screen; the two players
            start exploring the dungeon from different points.&amp;#xA;The basic gameplay is very simple. Enemies appear
            at specific points (they can also re-spawn), and must be defeated in order to proceed. The combat is
            turn-based at its core, though the turns follow very quickly, and the enemies will attack even if the player
            does nothing. Attacking is done simply by pressing a button; there are no other combat options.&amp;#xA;The
            player can find equipment and healing items (which can also be dropped by enemies). These can be used to
            restore the player character&apos;s HP outside of battles. Leveling up is completely automatic.&amp;#xA;There
            is no narrative in the game; the only story-related information comes in form of very short text intros to
            the different dungeons, along the lines of &quot;the king wants to retrieve a treasure and sends a warrior
            into the dungeon&quot; or comparable mission objectives.

            selects one of the two available main weapons: vulcan cannon (spreading fire, up to five directions if
            powered-up), and laser beam (powerful, focused fire; beams are added with power-ups). The secondary weapons
            include homing missiles, a bomb-like gadget, and a shield - all with limited ammunition/energy.&amp;#xA;The
            stages include real-world locations as well as abstract &quot;computer-like&quot; virtual reality worlds,
            with geometrical figures and computer-related objects as enemies. Boss enemies usually guard the exit to
            each level, and utilize a variety of shooting patterns to stop the hero. Anime-style cut scenes advance the
            story between the missions.

            which add realism to it. This includes several real brands advertised in the game, and others which have one
            or two letters changed in the logo, but are very easy to recognize. So it is with your opponents, featuring
            the great Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost or Nigel Mansell. The car behavior also features skids when speeding at
            corners, gears, and damage.

        <plot>F1 Circus &apos;91 is a Formula 1 simulation racing game. The series did not yet feature an official
            license, and so just like the first game it only features generic team and driver names. The game itself
            plays much the same, with the overhead race view and focus on car tuning and damage. The World Championship
            mode has of course returned, though the managerial Constructors mode is no longer present. There is also a
            Free Attack mode, where any course can be freely practiced; a Training mode, where special training courses
            can be raced on to learn the ins and outs of the game; and a Watch mode, where the player can choose a
            course and watch a demonstration race.

            encounters Challenging Stages, which are set to music and feature &quot;dancing&quot; enemies. The objective
            is to shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points. There are a total
            of 29 stages. The player can begin with one ship with two in reserve or start right out with a dual ship
            (but only one in reserve). Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that
            takes multiple shots to destroy. Others explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and
            occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that &quot;wiggle&quot; their way
            down the screen. Some enemies arrive in spherical &quot;eggs&quot; and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when
            hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main
            attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly
            straight down off the bottom of the screen. Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and
            it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield
            to other enemies. Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while
            in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side,
            then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and
            finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. In
            addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders
            and green blobs.

        <plot>Novel game in which you have to earn points by taking photographs of the most newsworthy happenings as you
            walk down the street. These involve people falling over, planes crashing, UFOs and many other bizarre
            events. You have a limited amount of film and have to be careful to dodge obstacles such as bouncing balls
            and skateboards, as contact means you drop some and when you run out the level is over.

        <plot>In the year 1192, the darkness of the Minamoto clan has come and is spreading across Japan. The country is
            being ravaged, and only one man of the lost Heike clan can return from the depths of hell to put a stop to
            it. His name is Taira no Kagekiyo. The story of Genpei Tōma Den ostensibly revolves around the historical
            Genpei War from Japanese history, and involves Taira no Kagekiyo fighting the evil Minamoto no Yoritomo and
            the Minamoto clan across Japan. The game features three modes of play: &quot;side mode&quot;, a small-scale
            action platforming section; &quot;big mode&quot;, a large-scale fighting section comparable to the Taito
            coin-op Gladiator; and &quot;flat mode&quot;, an overhead-view section. In all three sections the goal is to
            destroy enemies, collect items, and reach the end before the life bar (represented by burning candles) runs
            out.

            in multiple directions just to shake things up. They are also littered with enemies and obstacles, such as
            the fiery rocks that rain down from a volcano in the background. Unfortunately for Hany and friend, he&apos;s
            not blessed with a weapon of any kind, so to protect yourself you have to rely on dodging and jumping to
            stay alive. There are also plenty of items to collect that give anything from points to lives and some that
            clear the screen of enemies if you can get to them in time. Once the level is complete, you are on to the
            next one and are sometimes given a choice of which route to take.

            them in various ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can also pass to teammates, and execute special
            power throws which are harder to dodge or catch. The game includes several different game modes, including
            the main story mode which follows the story of the anime, as well as one- and two-player exhibition matches.
            There is also a &quot;league&quot; mode which allows for a tournament of up to six teams, as well as a

            take the role of a warrior who has been resurrected to fight an evil sorcerer. With a setting that mixes
            fantasy with Greek myth, you can easily see the influence of Ray Harryhausen movies like Jason and the
            Argonauts and Clash of the Titans. Your quest takes you over many areas from swamps to caves, and each is
            populated with the denizens of evil who are all out to get you. To aid you in your fight, there are white
            two-headed wolves. If you destroy one of these, it releases a power orb which, when collected, boosts your
            muscle power. These power-ups have two initial stages, with your sprite getting beefier with each one, but
            once three are collected you transform into a wild and powerful beast. These beasts vary from level to
            level, but range from a fireball-hurling wolf to a dragon with a powerful electric shock attack.

            The main goal of the game is to finish each course within a time limit. However, the presence of other cars
            and trucks (which may shoot at KITT or are simply in the way) make this difficult. Those can be overcome by
            either shooting them with one of the build-in weapon systems, jumping over them with the turbo boost or
            simply passing by. It is also important to keep on the road because ramming against lamp posts is unhealthy.
            KITT&apos;s abilities can be upgraded during the course of the game.

        <plot>In this game, the player takes control of a young nameless traveler. One day, the hero meets a man who
            tells him a sad story: monsters have kidnapped his granddaughter, and locked her away in a tower.
            Apparently, the monsters also took away nine other young girls, and have some evil plans in mind. The hero
            agrees to venture into the tower&apos;s labyrinth and succeed where no other adventurer could...&amp;#xA;Lady
            Sword is a first-person solo dungeon crawler. The player navigates the hero through the complex, maze-like
            corridors of the tower (with an auto-map feature), trying to find the right way to the stairs to the next
            floor. Fake walls, teleporters, one-way doors, items that must be collected to unlock hidden passages, boss
            enemies, etc., are there to make this task harder than it looks. Regular enemies pop out randomly, and must
            be defeated in a very simple turn-based combat.&amp;#xA;There is no damage feedback for the hero (though the
            player can see exactly how badly the hero himself is hurt), no weapons, armor, or items for combat usage.
            The player can heal the hero&apos;s wounds by selecting &quot;sleep&quot; from the menu. Sleeping restores
            the hero to full HP; but if he rests too much, a tough demon will appear and attack.&amp;#xA;Character
            growth is handled via direct stat increasing; there are no &quot;levels&quot;, and the hero&apos;s HP,
            attack and defense power, as well as agility, increase gradually the more he fights.&amp;#xA;On each floor,
            a digitized photo of a young woman will greet the hero and encourage the player to explore further - at the
            stairs to the next floor, should the hero overcome all the obstacles, the player will be able to see the
            girl naked.

            features one hundred levels which mostly differ from the original ones. Another difference is that the
            levels scroll. This is a platformer in which the protagonist needs to collect all gold which is spread out
            over the levels. Unfortunately there are a lot of enemies roaming around which should be avoided. The
            protagonist can&apos;t jump and so he needs to resort to ladders and horizontal ropes for dodging. The only
            way to temporarily get rid of a guard is to make a hole in the ground where they can&apos;t get out when
            falling in. After a certain amount of time a hole is filled up and a trapped guard respawns.

            can be spent in villages to purchase weapons and various types of armor, and experience points. Once a set
            amount of those is accumulated, the hero gains a level.&amp;#xA;Later in the game Shin receives spells and

            his name, &quot;peach guy&quot;). When he grows up, he goes to the island of demons, fights them, takes
            their treasure, and restores peace in its village. In this game, you don&apos;t play directly the story of
            Momotarou, but control three other popular characters from Japanese folklore, playing three separate
            stories: as Yashahime, the daughter of the Hell King Emma; Binbougami, or &quot;poverty god&quot;, who is
            hated by people because he takes money from them; and Urashima, the legendary fisherman who once saved a
            turtle and became friends with the dragon clan. Although the original stories have nothing or little to do
            with each other or the story of Momotarou, the game ties the stories together by featuring Momotarou as a
            character in every one of them.&amp;#xA;Despite being primarily a game for kids (the story is told in a
            fairy-tale fashion), this is a full-fledged console-style RPG with levels, party management, world map
            traveling, dungeons, towns, weapons and armors, and turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies,
            viewed from first person perspective.

        <plot>The sequel to Momotaro Densetsu continues its story, which is based on an old Japanese folk tale.
            Momotarou is a boy who was found by an old couple inside a giant peach. When he grew up, he found three
            faithful companions - a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, and with their help defeated the evil demons of the
            Demon Island. Three years have passed since. Momotarou and his friends do not suspect that deep beneath the
            Demon Island there lies a palace, in which resides Emma, the King of Hell. Unable to accept the victory of
            the humans over the demons, Emma sends his three most terrifying demonic servants to challenge the humans
            once again. It looks that Momotarou&apos;s adventure wasn&apos;t over, after all...&amp;#xA;Like the first
            game, this is an &quot;oldschool&quot; Japanese RPG with simple gameplay mechanics. Moving Momotarou over
            the world map, you visit towns, talk to people, buy weapons, and fight random enemies and bosses in
            turn-based combat viewed from first person perspective.

            old couple found a boy inside a giant peach, and named him &quot;Momotarou&quot; (peach boy). Later, the boy
            decided to rid the land of the evil demon tribe. Help Momotarou to reach the Demon Island and to defeat the
            demons!&amp;#xA;Gameplay-wise and graphically, this is a typical Momotarou RPG: navigating the little hero
            through the rop-down world map, you visit towns, descend into dungeons, equip Momotarou with weapons and
            armor, buy items, and fight random enemies and monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first person

            slimes, frogs, skeletons or minotaurs. During encounters fight animations are shown. The gameplay is
            generally identical to other Shogi games. The player controls various figures on a 9x9 board and tries to
            defeat an opponent. Each figure has its own rules for movement and attack.

            the goal to finish first. However, the screen always follows the leading vehicle and if a vehicle is left
            behind, it gets replaced on the current screen. Every vehicle has a fuel counter which gets a penalty if the
            vehicle is hit or needs to be replaced. Reaching zero ends the race. Players can choose between three
            vehicles which drive differently (car, tank or hovercraft) and, if they have gathered enough prize money,
            can upgrade it between races (including weapons). In contrast to the predecessor, the game has a futuristic

        <plot>Long time ago, the Gods fought the Demons in a cosmic battle. To ensure victory, the Gods had to sacrifice
            part of their divine nature, and forge a weapon that had both good and bad in it - the &quot;Evil Holy Sword&quot;
            Necromancer. The demons were forced to dwell in the lower world, while the Gods remained in the heaven.
            Between these two worlds lies the world of humans. But the demons did not accept this plan for co-existence.
            They have murdered the king of the human continent Ishumeria, and it&apos;s time for the nameless hero of
            this story to seek out the legendary sword Necromancer, and restore balance in the world. Jaseiken
            Necromancer plays like a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game: top-down navigation, linear story
            progression, turn-based battles against randomly appearing enemies, automatic leveling up, etc. A somewhat
            unusual (for the time) feature is the player&apos;s ability to choose two companions for the hero among six
            possible ones. These warriors are introduced to the hero after he accepts his quest, and the player can
            build a party of three, trying to balance between physical and magical skills they possess. The game is also
            notable for its rather dark themes, uncommon for the representatives of its genre at that time. Enemies
            mostly include demonic creatures, and their death animation contains graphical gore.

            (Knight, Mage, Amazon, Samurai, Elf, Dwarf, Berserker, and Mercenary) defeated him and restored peace. The
            game is divided into chapters; in the first one, the player takes control of the Mercenary, who is separated

            dangerous discoveries, and eventually he has to reunite with his friends in order to face the evil once
            again. The player controls the Mercenary in the first chapter, but plays as other heroes as well (up to an
            active party of three) later in the game. The game is structured like a traditional top-down Japanese-style
            RPG, with random enemies and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Stand-out feature of
            the game are animated attacks: every attack in battle is presented as a short animated sequence, separate
            from the battle screen. Unlike most other RPGs of the time, Necros no Yōsai does not feature a freely
            explorable &quot;world map&quot;. Instead, player-controlled characters move in a strictly linear fashion to
            icons that represent towns and hostile areas.

            on the moon, the evil Axis Empire launches a lunar military campaign and takes over the moon, using its

            or capturing the enemy base camp. There are many different units that both sides utilize - infantry, tanks,

            an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there&apos;s no extra time whatsoever. In the game you
            always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders
            to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is
            totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made
            this way to be funnier to play against friends.

            leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis
            scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua,
            Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook.&amp;#xA;If Tiki doesn&apos;t rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of
            time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait
            Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making
            the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and
            arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than
            not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points.
            However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all
            these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and
            fireballs.&amp;#xA;In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only
            way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other
            areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to
            the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at
            enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

            gameplay has strong grand strategy elements and is similar to Koei&apos;s &quot;historical simulation&quot;
            series. The player can choose to control either the Northern or the Southern forces, choosing the actions
            for the leader and all his vassals. The player can choose to engage in diplomacy with rulers of other
            provinces, sign agreements, and manage and navigate armies. Combat takes place on a separate top-down grid,
            on which he player navigates the soldiers in turn-based fashion. Individual battles proceed automatically,

        <plot>Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which two ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is
            revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest
            to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with
            whom Ryu&apos;s father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy
            involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a
            terrifying evil upon the world. In comparison to the better known console version this game is a traditional
            fighting game similar to Double Dragon in which the player walks from left to right while battling numerous
            enemies. Only if all foes are dispatched of, the player can advance in the level. It&apos;s also possible to
            perform special attacks and use weapons. The latter are either collectable power-ups or environmental
            objects like phone boots. Ryu can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for
            a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks,
            performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil
            drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points,
            Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with five units. The game
            takes place in United States&apos; locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand
            Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same five kinds, including Jason Vorhees&apos;
            look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage. A two-player co-operative
            game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a
            table while a circular saw descends upon him.

            Depending on the enemy type and outcome of the battle, the robot receives different amounts of experience.

            will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss.&amp;#xA;There are
            sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause
            ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit
            that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake.
            He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.

        <plot>There is something wrong with your brain. It is being taken over by the Devil Ugar himself! Your only
            recourse is to fight back against this hostile invasion. Thankfully your mind has created the ultimate
            weapon: a ship with which you can navigate the five causes (stages) and blast back the Devil&apos;s evil
            minions. It is your only hope, your one last chance to free your mind from this evil influence. Psychosis is
            a side-scrolling shooter where each level is meant to represent a different location within your mind. One
            looks like the sky, another filled with aquatic plants, one with what resemble tetris blocks. It is within
            these stages that you must blast everything in sight while collecting power ups to upgrade your weapon and
            shield. You can gain two floating balls that resemble mechanical eyes and can be directed 360 degrees around
            your ship to either act as a shield or to direct your weapon. Battle your way through each stage and defeat
            the boss at the end and eventually you&apos;ll do battle against the very DEVIL himself.

        <plot>Bonk&apos;s Adventure is a prehistoric platform game where you are in control of a large bald headed
            caveman, guiding him through the levels taking out all manner of strange prehistoric creatures that get in
            your way including King Drools henchmen - all in effort to free the captured/controlled residents of
            Moonland (bosses) - including the Princess Za from King Drool attempted take over. The game is not unlike
            other platform games of the era. Though it&apos;s unique in that you can climb walls and swing on rope with
            your teeth and your only method of attack is head butting enemies - straight forward or dive bomb style. The
            game starts off with simplistic point A to point B style, but focuses more on exploration in the later
            stages, which include finding hidden bonus areas. The game is also known for its trademark gameplay
            mechanism of &apos;spin attack&apos;, where Bonk floats through the air if you have the turbo button on.
            This can be used to float around the level and reach areas for extra/hidden items, but also as a method of
            attack as well. The game starts you off with 3 hearts, but allows you to increase this number when you find
            special heart container items, allowing Bonk to take a number of hits before dying. A variety of bonus
            stages can be found throughout the game, which provide bonus points upon completion and thus resulting in
            accumulating extra lives. Enemies themselves can be &apos;milked&apos; for points in that you can keep
            &apos;bonking&apos; their dead bodies and not letting them hit the ground. Spin attack is another method for
            doing this.

        <plot>Bonk&apos;s Big Adventure is the third instalment in the side-scrolling platformer series. As in previous
            games, the player assumes the role of a caveman named Bonk who headbutts his way through various enemies in
            order to defeat King Drool. Familiar moves include swinging on trees, bouncing off walls, breaking blocks
            and climbing walls with his teeth. Compared to the previous games, he walks and moves a little faster. Bonk
            has the new ability to pick up red and blue candy power-ups that make him grow or shrink and grab a flower
            copter. As always, there is plenty of platforming and enemies to discover. The game consists of seven
            rounds, set in the Dinosaur Kingdom, finished off with a boss. At the end of each stage, 16 smileys can be
            exchanged to play up to eight different bonus stages (2 smileys per stage needed). New level elements
            include ziplines and sewer pipes. The game also features a cooperative multiplayer mode.

        <plot>Power Eleven is a top-down soccer game with three playing modes: multiplayer, penalty kicks (shown from

            and features twelve national soccer teams. Then the player needs to defeat the other teams with rising
            difficulty to win the Hudson Cup. Regarding rules, the game features no fouls or off-sides. Each athlete has
            a rating in the five statistics (run, dribble, kick, technique and power) which influences his performance
            on the field. The player can also choose between different formations and after successful matches athletes
            can be substituted. The most unusual aspect of the game is the power rating which is lowered when using the
            power mode which allows faster movement and forceful shots. However, the power does only get completely
            refilled after a match so it needs to be used with care. Because the activation of this mode takes up a
            button, there is no dedicated passing button to be found. The distance of a shot is chosen by pressing the
            fire button quickly or holding it.

        <plot>Pro Tennis World Court game with a twist. The action itself features no big surprises: the players control
            their characters over the scrolling tennis field and try to counter balls from their opponents. It is
            possible to perform typical tennis actions like cross, smash or lob and the hit performance depends on the
            timing. However, the unique feature of this game is a story mode which takes various elements from Japanese
            role-playing games. The story involves an evil king who banned all tennis matches outside of membership
            courts. The player goes out to overthrow the king so tennis can be brought back to everyone. So the player
            explores a top-down world map reminiscent of Dragon Warrior, explores the surrounding and fights enemies.
            Those fights are either random encounters or scripted boss battles and play out as regular tennis matches.
            The overall goal is to find all membership courts and defeat the inhabitants. Because of this, the game does
            not end when defeated; the player gets dragged to the king and has to pay a penalty fee. Money is the only
            resource and is earned by defeating enemies. It is used to buy updated equipment: shoes improve speed,
            rackets improve power and shirts help to evade random encounters. The game is no RPG, however, because there
            is no actual character development.

            maze and needs to find the way to the exit. The obstacles on the way are boxes which can be pushed but not
            pulled, holes and revolving doors. The game features three playing modes, most notably the level mode with
            100 levels. They are divided over four sets of 20 each. Those sets have a difficulty level associated with
            them and each rewards the same ending when solved. The other two modes are the challenge mode (solving ten
            levels in a limited amount of time) and a split-screen multiplayer mode.

        <plot>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them
            all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a
            block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.&amp;#xA;There
            are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a
            block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations
            there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks
            one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately
            removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level
            arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by
            forming a stack, for example)&amp;#xA;The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each
            batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix
            of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that
            there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level
            (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of
            your 3 lives.

        <plot>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot &apos;em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.
            You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.&amp;#xA;The
            R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without
            firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of
            energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in
            your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called
            &quot;The Force&quot;, which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship,
            absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use
            it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in
            R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and
            in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger
            main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends
            laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow
            one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).&amp;#xA;The stages of R-Type are
            made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger&apos;s artwork for the Alien movies. When it
            came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other
            shoot&apos;em&apos;ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth,
            where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate
            tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the
            memorisation that is required of R-Type&apos;s contemporary rival, Gradius.

            arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile
            next to it on at least one side. This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on

            multiplayer mode.

            randomly appearing enemies. The battles take place on separate side-scrolling screens, and are fully
            action-based. Laila can jump, duck, and attack with melee or ranged weapons. Typically there are several
            enemies on the screen; Laila escapes the battle if she reaches the end of the short side-scrolling area.&amp;#xA;Enemies
            leave orbs of various colors and chests upon defeat; these serve to heal Laila, grant her experience points,
            &quot;mind points&quot;, or ammunition for the firearms. Laila starts with a knife and a pistol, but later
            gains access to more powerful firearms. These weapons can be enhanced with Laila&apos;s psychic techniques,
            which, in their turn, require mind points.

            project. After a flash of lightning and a scream, Jennifer is gone, and Rick is left wearing the Terror

            corpses, demons, and other disturbing creatures in this arcade side-scrolling beat-em-up. Several weapons
            are at Rick&apos;s disposal throughout the house, such as a meat cleaver, a two by four, and a shotgun. If
            Rick wants to find Jennifer alive, he must move quickly through the floors of the mansion... as a happy

        <plot>The board game Stratego is a more elaborate version of Capture the Flag. Each player starts with 40
            pieces; made up by the flag, 5 bombs, and an assortment of 9 types of military units. After these have been
            placed, each player takes it in turn to move their pieces. Other than scouts (which are the least powerful)
            the units can only move one space at a time.The flag and bombs can&apos;t be moved during the game, so watch
            out for any squares the computer does not move when it otherwise logically should, and these could be your
            goal. When you choose a square occupied by an opposition piece, combat arises, and the higher-numbered piece
            is lost from the game. You have no way of knowing what strength the opposition pieces are until you have hit
            them. This computerized interpretation has 3 different board layouts, a selection of automatic setups with
            different strategic benefits, and a demo mode.

            most respects to the original Street Fighter II (which never turned up on the Genesis anyway) except that
            all 12 characters are selectable from the get-go (the boss characters were originally locked) and the game

        <plot>The game is based on the eponymous manga (sometimes transliterated as Susa no Oh) by Go Nagai. The
            protagonist is a seemingly ordinary teenager named Susa, who discovers that he contains within himself
            another persona, the destructive Japanese god Susanoo. The game&apos;s story begins right where the manga
            ended (with a cliffhanger): Susa faces his rival Uryu, who causes him to unleash the power of Susanoo,
            devastating the world and releasing evil spirits that take it in their possession. Having returned to his
            normal self, Susa has to find his sweetheart Yukishiro and other friends, and figure out a way to undo the
            damage he has inflicted on the world.&amp;#xA;Susanoo Densetsu is notable for implementing a setting and
            gameplay themes unusual for Japanese RPGs of its time. Among those is a day/night cycle, which influences
            the appearance of monsters on the world map as well as schedules of characters in the towns (for example,
            shops are closed at night). It is also one of the first Japanese RPGs in which enemies wander around visibly
            on the world map, sometimes surrounding the player, Ultima-style, and can be avoided.&amp;#xA;The battle
            system is also reminiscent of Ultima, featuring free movement on the top-down battle screen. The fights are
            held in fast-paced turn-based style; to pause the fight, the player has to bring up the menu and select a
            command. Similarly to Emerald Dragon, action points are spent when moving and/or selecting commands.&amp;#xA;Later
            in the game Susa teams up with two other characters; he can also recruit mercenaries to help him in battles.
            Characters learn the so-called &quot;ESP powers&quot; when leveling up, which are equivalent to magic
            spells.

            Originating in the arcades, Truxton is a vertically scrolling shooter. The player controls a fighter craft
            that has to eliminate the enemies with primary weapons or bombs. The basic weapon comes in three varieties:
            Power Shot (small spreading projectiles), Sun Laser (a powerful, fast-moving straight laser beam, and
            Truxton Beam (an electric beam that spreads in all directions if the player is holding down the fire
            button). Each one of these weapons can be upgraded to a more powerful variant by collecting power-ups (up to
            four power levels). Beside increased attack power, the weapons also may gain additional properties when
            powering up (e.g. the Power Shot creates a shield around the player-controlled aircraft). Other power-up
            effects include increasing the ship&apos;s maneuvering speed up to four times, increasing the number of
            bombs, and gaining additional lives.

            have a learning curve that starts off very easy then ramps up, but this is pretty tricky from the beginning.

        <plot>Time Cruise is a pinball game with a story. The story has a scientist by the name of Eric who one day
            hears a voice claiming to be an extraterrestrial and through this voice learns the secret to time travel.
            After several years of building his creation, he is finally finished and crawls in to his round metal time
            machine and is off on a quest to travel through time and meet his extraterrestrial friend. The goal of the
            game, much like many others in the genre, is to reach a certain amount of points in one of several different
            pinball tables that range in different time periods including prehistoric times and up to the future.

        <plot>Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.&amp;#xA;For some reason, mad professors of the future tend
            to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys&apos; variant is
            called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all
            destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black
            ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant
            speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off
            it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in
            a direction of your choice.&amp;#xA;The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also
            increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine
            lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or
            destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game
            speed can be slowed down by holding the space key - a very useful option in tricky situations.&amp;#xA;Titan
            mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements
            (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately,
            yet indirectly.

            shots are possible. On defense, body checking an opposing player can lead to a special fight sequence.
            Exhibition games can be played with either full or easy rules - easy mode has less penalties and infractions
            like offside. In tournaments, every scheduled game can either be played or the results simulated. Tournament
            progress is saved via a password. When two or more players play, they can be put on any team. Thus teams

            performance during a match does not only depend on the player&apos;s ability but also on the athlethe&apos;s
            statistics (e.g. agility or dribbling) and their energy. Energy decreases during the course of a match and
            describes how much power an athlete has left. There are also three different defense tactics (one-on-one
            defense, zone defense or a mix between the two) which can be set before the match or during interceptions.
            During the matches, the player controls the ball carrier when in offense and manually switches between
            athletes when in defense. Passes can be performed in a high or low variation. While most of the match is
            shown in a slightly heightened side-scrolling perspective, the game switches to a close-up view during a
            penalty throw or a dunking try. Here the player needs to press a button at the correct timing for a
            successful throw. When a defense athlete is nearby during a during maneuver, he has the opportunity to block
            the ball when the correct timing is met.

            any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers

        <plot>Valkyrie no Densetsu is a sequel to Valkyrie no Bōken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu, which puts you in the shoes
            of a young Valkyrie of Norse mythology as she sets out to reclaim the fabled golden seed, which has been
            stolen by an evil god. The gameplay is top-down action with platformer elements, discarding the RPG elements
            of the previous game. You must navigate the many levels that compose Valhalla and defeat all the enemies in
            your path while sorting out chasms and other platformer-styled obstacles. You can also find several NPCs in
            each stage, who offer gameplay hints, clues and items to buy with the gold stolen from fallen enemies. You
            can buy health power-ups, improved weapons and even magic spells for added fire-power.

            animals, such as koalas who serve as bookmakers. The game also features managerial elements, as the players
            must manage their racers. The player can choose to play as one of four rabbits and name them. The racing

            location where the ball is hit. The courses feature many obstacles which should be avoided and wind which
            should be calculated in. Besides the single-player mode in which the player participates in tournaments
            there are also two multiplayer modes: one for two players and another one for up to four players. The basic
            goal for both is to have the lowest amount of hits after 18 holes, but in the second mode there are penalty
            points assigned for every hit above the hole&apos;s limit.

            tournament. The second athlete can also be played by a second human player. The controls offer no surprises:
            players move an athlete over the field and use two buttons for jumping and hitting. Single players also have
            to switch between the two athletes. However, each athlete has a n energy value which decreases over the
            course of a match. By using a water bottle the energy gets filled up again, but there is only a limited
            amount available. When using the training mode instead of the tournament, players can choose between one of
            three fields and an easy mode which is basically a slow motion mode.

            projectile attack and, once defeated, monsters leave behind money which can be exchanged in-game for health
            and other unique power-ups. Bosses are based on several Buddhist tales; being much too powerful for

        <plot>Zero4 Champ is a racing simulation game inspired by Japanese urban street racing, its name derived from
            the traditional racing distance (0 to 400 meters). A versus mode allows players to compete against each
            other or computer AI in first-person-view races; however, the game&apos;s main mode is the Story Mode, which
            has strong simulation elements. The player takes the role of a young racer, competing in tournaments and
            gradually advancing in rank. It is possible to buy car parts or whole vehicles, as well as customize cars.
            Money is obtained from prizes or by doing part-time jobs. These jobs are sometimes designed as mini-games;
            for example, working as a security guard involves inspecting rooms in a first-person environment. It is also
            possible to play simple arcade games such as UFO catcher or Turbo Racing.
