        <plot>Bandits are holding up a bank and have taken people hostage, and as a gunslinger, it&apos;s your job to
            shoot them. The bank has 12 doors, and the bandits are behind each one of them. When they pull a gun out at
            you when you open a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If you shoot them
            too early (ie: before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair, and you won&apos;t score any
            points, but if you&apos;re too late, he&apos;ll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives. If you waste
            too much time, a bandit will come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on it. You must then shoot
            the dynamite to get rid of it. If you&apos;re lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold
            coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than not, the person
            will throw his/her hands up, saying &quot;I haven&apos;t got anything&quot;. That&apos;s when they will be
            replaced by bandits. Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and shooting at
            all of the gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the
            rope, there&apos;s more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you&apos;ll
            get three bags of gold coins.There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person
            behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get.
            For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also,
            regardless of what round you&apos;re on, you can shoot so many bandits before time &quot;

            can find it, lies within the Black Tower near the town of Utsuro. You assemble a party of brave adventurers
            and venture into the tower, defeating monsters on your way to the great treasure.The Black Onyx is one of
            the first traditional role-playing games made by a Japanese company. It is similar in gameplay to early
            Wizardry and Ultima games with killing monsters and exploring dungeons, with dark, realistic visuals. The
            player creates a party (up to five members) and explores a maze-like 3D dungeon, fighting random enemies on
            the way. The heroes also meet adventurers who can be convinced to join the party. The combat engine is
            turn-based.

        <plot>Borderline is an overhead arcade shooter that puts the player in control of a Jeep in a war zone. The Jeep
            is equipped with a gun that has unlimited ammunition. Each round consists of four stages; after the player
            has completed all of them, the game proceeds to the next round, with increased difficulty. The first stage
            is a vertically scrolling shooter: the player can move the Jeep in all directions, shooting at enemies that
            try to destroy it by collision; the goal is simply to survive. The other stages share a different gameplay
            concept: the player has to navigate the Jeep towards enemy refineries and destroy them all. Enemy tanks will
            spawn indefinitely, trying to stop the Jeep. Parts of the stage are covered by bushes, and the Jeep has to
            furrow through them before advancing. In the third stage rockets can be picked up for bonus score. In the
            fourth and final stage the sole refinery is well-protected and shoots missiles at the Jeep.

        <plot>You are Agent 17 (codename: &quot;Otto&quot;). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a
            security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building. Enemies spies are
            scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs.
            There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them: Shooting them with his gun. Kicking them by jumping
            onto them. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.
            Crushing them with an elevator. Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short
            period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already
            dark. While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can
            still get killed if he&apos;s already in an elevator if a bullet&apos;s trajectory is aimed at it.. When
            Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it.
            Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling
            off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him,
            causing him to fall. Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn&apos;t mean that elevators are
            the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to
            avoid gunfire and don&apos;t have time to jump. Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the
            top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and
            must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then
            proceeds to the next building. If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off,
            and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be
            especially aggressive. The alarm doesn&apos;t go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing
            a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It&apos;s
            virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an
            elevator.

            At the end of each level, bonus points are given according to your remaining barrier. Losing a ship means
            you lose all your weapons upgrades as well. As usual with a shooter from this maker, the powerups come in
            the shape of numbered pods that are released from Zanac-style blocks. Different upgrades give higher shot
            counts, more simultaneous bullets or bigger energy waves. At certain score intervals, you&apos;re granted

        <plot>N-Sub puts the player in control of a submarine in the Cobalt Blue Sea. The action takes place on one
            screen; the player-controlled submarine can move in all directions and must defend itself against an
            onslaught of enemy ships and submarines by firing torpedoes at them. Torpedoes can be fired vertically
            (which is the only way to hit ships) and horizontally (to deal with enemy submarines), activated by two
            different buttons. Pressing the button down allows firing short bursts of three torpedoes each. A round is
            over after an enemy fleet of twelve ships and a destroyer has completed a fixed amount of loops. Subsequent
            rounds increase the difficulty by making enemy ships more aggressive.

            enemies on your quest to recapture territories and to take back the Castle all of which have been captured
            and occupied by the enemy forces. Throwing knives and shuriken are your weapons as you shoot your way
            through enemy occupied territory. Coming into contact with any enemies or any of their thrown projectile
            weapons equals instant death. Unlike the original arcade machine, the SG-1000 and MSX ports contain only 13
            levels instead of 16.

            of Terram has constructed a terrifying weapon that can destroy space-time. The player character, piloting
            the Orguss craft, has 2:30 minutes to get to the weapon and deactivate it. This is done by flying either in
            the native ship form, or transforming into the powerful mecha Orgroid. The mecha shoots repeatedly if the
            player presses the fire button, while the ship&apos;s gun has to be fire separately for each shot. However,
            when the protagonist is in mecha form the screen scrolls slower, preventing the player from getting to the
            weapon in time. Enemies include hostile craft and stationary turrets on the ground. There are no power-ups

            causes Pacar to reverse, and reversing is significantly slower than driving normally. Ideally the player

            down. As soon as you tranquilize an animal, a timer will begin to count down and you will have to slowly
            drag the animal back to your truck before the timer reaches zero or the animal will awaken and kill you. Not
            only do you need to consider the countdown timer for a tranquilized animal, but you also need to watch your
            trucks fuel gauge, which is basically a time limit counter for the game as you apparently leave your truck

        <plot>Space Armor is a shoot-&apos;em-up game developed and published by Tsukuda Original. It was built with the
            Othello Multivision in mind, but like all Multivision games, is also compatible with the SG-1000.The game is
            built similarly to Namco&apos;s Xevious, in that it is a vertical shooter where one button fires at flying
            targets and the other at ground targets.

        <plot>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens
            begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to
            earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the
            end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to
            the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer
            will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser cannon are
            three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien&apos;s bombs, but will also block your own shots.
            You begin the game with a limited number of laser cannons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.

        <plot>Star Jacker is a vertically scrolling shoot &apos;em up where the player controls a Universe Squadron
            whose job is to attack various enemy space colonies while evading or destroying the enemies UFO forces
            before returning to the Star Jacker mother ship. The main difference from other shooters is that the player
            here controls three space ships at once. As the front ship move the others follow its trail. This means that
            the player can shoot three shots at a time but it also means that enemy projectiles are harder to avoid
            since the ships take more space. However if hit the size of the squadron will decrease. The player has two
            means of attack: a regular fire for shooting down UFOs and a bomb attack for taking out ground targets. If a
            high score is attained a mystery target will appear. By destroying this the squadron will warp to the mother
            ship. The player will then be granted one extra ship and then game will continue. The game goes on until all
            ships in the squadron have been lost.

        <plot>Just when things were going great with Tom-Tom and his girlfriend Tanya, some thug of a woodland king had
            to kidnap her and hide her away, and Tom-Tom doesn&apos;t have a clue where. That&apos;s why he has to
            explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and
            even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic
            locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs,
            bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom&apos;s only line of defense
            against these menaces. There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can&apos;t
            be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can
            break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels.
            You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don&apos;t collide with an inhabitant. When
            you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you&apos;ll start the next round still riding it.
            As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting
            milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are
            also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows
            you, you&apos;ll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to
            destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts. There are also warp-gates, but you don&apos;t find them,
            they find you. Warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item
            will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a
            bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as
            many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the
            hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you&apos;ll get further in
            the round

            planes until it is game over but the more you destroy then the higher the round you play on. You take
            control of two cross-hairs, one for firing bullets and the other for missiles and they both move together
            when you move them left or right which also moves your ship. When you move them up or down, then they move
            at different speeds and the bullets are for shooting down the planes and the missiles for the boats which
            has a short delay between firing. As the boats move across the screen from left to right they will fire
            missiles and torpedoes at you and these can be shot or avoided and if you are hit by one then you lose one
            of three lives. Two players can play and each player takes it in turns to play when the other player has
            been killed.

            increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are three distinct skill levels, while
