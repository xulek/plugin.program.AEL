        <plot>Amok portrays a futuristic storyline on a planet which is identified in the manual as having the same
            name. There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been
            having an all-out war between them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and
            theaters, including operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea, and beneath the water. Very
            recently, a weak peace accord had only just been reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as
            being much like &quot;a blanket covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people. The agreement
            is sufficiently unsteady that an influential mercenary company, known only as &quot;the Bureau,&quot; has
            now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue
            to make large amounts of money by taking lucrative contracts from both sides. The player takes the role of
            Gert Staun.&amp;#xA;Naturally &quot;the Bureau&quot; has placed a high priority on this, and they are
            funding it entirely on their own. Indeed, Gert Staun&apos;s battle walker, called the &quot;Slambird&quot;
            is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the Slambird can not only survive either on land or
            underwater, but it can transition between the two -- it can move, fight, and safely control its vertical
            position in either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and not standard to such vehicles in
            the universe where Amok takes place. The transformation of the Slambird between an underwater vehicle and a
            land vehicle is automatically scripted, however. The player has no power to control this transformation or
            alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when Staun will automatically
            bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.&amp;#xA;The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a
            series of objectives, and to do so in such a way that each side will blame the other. The game has a linear
            structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets
            are encountered. These include military bases, power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines --
            even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be killed by being
            run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get enough time to escape is to open
            with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport
            vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety of explosive devices
            and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in
            addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons are
            useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can be
            used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are
            automatically used instead of missiles.

        <plot>Alien Trilogy is a first-person shooter based on the first three Alien movies. You control Lt. Ripley in
            three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from
            Alien³) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every
            mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies,
            finding items or activating switches.&amp;#xA;Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides:
            facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in
            the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the
            Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct
            your mission.&amp;#xA;Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun.
            Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be
            uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting
            lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the
            motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.

        <plot>In Alone in the Dark -One Eyed Jack&apos;s Revenge, you take the role of detective Edward Carnby, one of

            bootlegger named One Eyed Jack after an old detective college name Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping
            of young Grace Saunders. Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack&apos;s dilapidated mansion of Hell&apos;s
            Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That&apos;s where Carnby comes in.&amp;#xA;Carnby
            soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack
            joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also
            requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace&apos;s kidnapping).&amp;#xA;Now
            Carnby must battle his way through Hell&apos;s Kitchen and Jack&apos;s army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters,
            searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead.&amp;#xA;Alone in the Dark 2 is an
            action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark. Like its predecessor, the game uses hybrid
            2D-3D graphics. Completing the game requires you to solve a lot of puzzles while fighting zombie pirates
            along the way. Some enemies can be killed with the numerous weapons at your disposal, while others need to
            be defeated via trickery.&amp;#xA;Apart from Edward Carnby, the game also includes a short section (two
            sections in the CD-ROM version) where you play as the little Grace Saunders. Grace obviously cannot fight,
            and thus the sections featuring her are all about fast reflexes and wits to evade and outsmart the enemies.

            pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is
            a bonus item, the &quot;BB coin&quot;, which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from
            the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent&apos;s playfield all at once, increasing the
            difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she&apos;ll win when her opponents get
            their playfield piled to the top.

        <plot>This baseball game features real MLBPA players from the 1994 baseball season. The teams they actually
            played for are only represented by the cities the actual teams are from. The game has an Exhibition mode, a
            Regular Season mode, and a Championship Game mode. The Regular Season mode lets the player choose to play
            either a 13, 26, 52, or 162 game season, while the Championship Game mode lets the player play either a 3,5,
            or 7 game championship game series against an opposing team. The game also allows baseball players to be
            traded to other teams, and it also allows the player to select to play in 1 of 7 different MLB ballparks,
            plus one extra ballpark designed by Jaleco. Gameplay options include turning automatic fielding on or off.
            When on the field, batting makes use of a behind the batter view, while pitching makes use of a behind the
            pitcher view. Pitching is kept simple by the player being only able to control where the pitch goes, while
            batting only involves timing the swing to make contact with the pitched ball.

            different locations. Players can compete in these locations in three different ways. One way, is called war,
            with the objective to destroy every one of their opponent&apos;s ships. Another way, is to play capture the

            weapon, and defensive weapon.&amp;#xA;Gameplay has players moving their ships strategically on an overhead
            map. When two ships move close enough to each other, a battle can happen. In the battle, players try
            maneuvering a target reticule on their opponent ship to attack them, while also attempting to move out of
            the way of their opponents attacks. Once one of the ships health meters become empty from taking to much

            each other. In the opening introduction, the somewhat inept clockwork knight Pepperouchau is competing with
            some other knights for the affections of a princess who lives in the clock. Everyone is having a grand time
            until a rogue toy shows up through the air vent, absconds with the princess, and turns many of the other
            toys against Pepperouchau.&amp;#xA;The gameplay consists of side scrolling action through various stages
            constructed of elaborate series of toys, traps, and common household items. The first stage is a quest
            through Betsy&apos;s room with lots of letter blocks, sharp crayons, and dollhouses precariously balanced on
            robots that tend to fall on you. Pepperouchau is armed with a key sword that has offensive use as well as
            the ability to open boxes that functions as warps to other areas. The second stage takes place in Betsy&apos;s
            brother&apos;s room. Kevin has a lot of engineering skill and has built an impressive network of cranes and
            trains that Pepperouchau will need to activate in order to clear the area. Watch out for the jet transformer
            boss at the end of the room.&amp;#xA;Other stages include missions through other areas of the house
            including the kitchen and the attic. Throughout the game you also collect coins. 20 coins are worth a
            continue when you run out of lives. Further, you meet other friendly toys between levels who give you the

        <plot>Criticom is a one-on-one fighting game where 8 diverse fighters from across the galaxy vie for a crystal
            artifact. The game features a sci-fi backstory that involves mystery and intrigue surrounding the crystal
            and each of the 8 fighters is given a unique storyline to explain why he or she is so interested in the
            artifact. Among the colorful characters are a giant lizard man named Gorm, a ninja lady named Yenji, a
            killing robot named S.I.D., and a mysterious vampire-like creature named Demonica who places little value on
            clothing.&amp;#xA;The fighting action takes place on a round, elevated platform. Each fighter begins the
            fight with a full power meter and one power meter refill in reserve that is activated when the primary meter
            is depleted. Thus, there are no rounds. The fight runs until one fighter is knocked out (no more power in
            their meter), one is knocked out of the arena (or steps/jumps out), or the time runs out.

            launchers and lasers, to really exotic weapons like microwave cannon, EMP discharger, and even plasma

        <plot>The first in the Dead or Alive series, and features many of the same features that has made the DoA series
            so popular today; somewhat realistic combat, good character design, and scantily clad women whose breasts
            bounce a lot.&amp;#xA;The game doesn&apos;t mess too much with a background story- it&apos;s a 3D one on one
            fighter that takes place within an arena of limited space. Each character has their own unique way of
            fighting, their own abilities, and even their own hobbies and likes. (For example, Ryu Hayabusa- yes, he of
            Ninja Gaiden fame- likes sushi, mountain climbing, and fishing.)

        <plot>Sega&apos;s own version of Decathlon, the most grueling of multi-event sports consisting of the 100-Meter
            Dash, Long Jump, Shot Put, High Jump, 400-Meter Race, 110-Meter Hurdles, Discus Throw, Pole Vault, Javelin
            Throw and the 1500-Meter Race, split over two days of competition. Featuring eight athletes with different
            abilities and specialties, from the agile Karl Vain and Femi Kadiena, the fast Li Huang and Ellen Reggiani,
            the well balanced Joe Kudou and Rick Blade to the powerhouses Aleksei Rigel and Jef Jansens, the player must
            achieve the best scores possible in each event to get to the World&apos;s best results table, not only in
            the decathlon points table but also on the individual events table.&amp;#xA;All events follow the core
            gameplay of other athletics titles (such as Track &amp; Field), with some changes from event to event.
            Spriting events such as the 100-meter dash are pure button-bashing, with the 110-Meter Hurdles requiring an
            additional tap in the action button to pass the athlete at the correct time over the hurdle without losing
            speed or knocking it down. At the opposite level, the 400-Meter and the 1500-Meter Race add a stamina bar
            that must be kept above critical levels at all times to keep the athlete fresh until the end, this being
            done by simply pacing the number of presses done by the player (the 1500M also requires the player to steer
            the athlete in the best path: as close as possible to the inside edge without hitting other runners or
            losing speed from going over the edge). Jumping events, along the javelin, require a fast build-up, an
            well-timed action (be it jump, set the pole or release the javelin), and setting the most appropriate angle.
            Discus is the only event where button mashing isn&apos;t required, and asks the player to rotate the D-pad
            clockwise to build strenght, followed by a push of the action button to set the angle of release as well as
            the direction.&amp;#xA;Like in the original ST-V version (which means it is in every way similar to the
            arcade version), two players can compete at the same time in the running event, and at the 1500M race six
            drones compete at the same time.

        <plot>Dragon Ball Z - The Legend is a game that adds another Dragon Ball to the franchise of the same name and
            starts with the events of the Saiyan Saga and the fight with Vegeta and Nappa. In Idainaru Dragon Ball
            Densetsu you don&apos;t have your natural one on one fights. At the beginning of each fight you are given a
            total of 4 fighters (up to 6 later) from which you have to choose the 3 that you would like to participate
            in the battle that follows. Each fighter has 2 bars - a green and a yellow one. The green represents the
            life force and the yellow the power force which is depleted with every attack you do. At the bottom of the
            screen there is a blue bar and a red one that form a gauge called Power Balance. The reason for this gauge
            to be there is because your attacks don&apos;t affect the enemies&apos; life bar directly. By continuously
            attacking the enemy the bar that represents your power (blue bar) increases while that of the enemy (red
            bar) decreases. When the blue bar covers all the gauge a random attack sequence, from the current character
            you&apos;re controlling, is initiated and that&apos;s how you can actually injure your opponents. The same
            can happen to you though if the enemy&apos;s red bar covers all the gauge.

            launchers, but also his mighty foot to kick enemies. The game sports a high level of interactivity. Many
            objects in the environment can be broken or interacted with, such as pool tables, arcade machines, glass,
            light switches and security cameras. As a mature game, the protagonist is also able to hand strippers a
            dollars to have them remove their top.&amp;#xA;The character, voiced by Jon St. John, also regularly
            delivers commentary on the events through one liners. There are 28 levels, divided over three episodes, set
            in locations such as streets, a church, a space station, a Japanese villa, a football field and many modern
            environments. Enemies mainly include aliens, mutated humans and members of the police force that have been
            turned into Pig Cops. Next to weapons, Duke also has access to medikits, steroids to enhance his speed,
            nightvision, protective boots, a hologram known as the holoduke, and a jet pack to reach higher areas. Most
            of the gameplay is action-oriented, but there is also an amount of puzzles needed to progress or access
            secret areas.&amp;#xA;The game includes network play through the IPX protocol, for deathmatch and
            cooperative games.

        <plot>Virtua Fighter 2 was full of many brand new gameplay elements implemented into the realistic fighting
            engine of the first Virtua Fighter. The Virtua Fighter series has been heralded before as the fighting game
            with most involving gameplay.&amp;#xA;In Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called
            Fighting Vipers. Fighting Vipers has drastically different gameplay than the more popular Virtua Fighter 2.
            Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is simplified to appeal to a wider audience of video gamers
            and was meant for &quot;casual&quot; gamers.&amp;#xA;Mixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated
            video game must have been difficult. But Fighters Megamix manages to do so by offering many options. The
            most important option available is the choice of having Fighters Megamix run under the Fighting Vipers style
            of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of gameplay. Other options are unlockable while playing the game.&amp;#xA;One
            good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include more selectable characters. Not
            only are there the 22 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers but there are also 10 other
            hidden characters that can be unlocked by playing well in the Saturn version, including two from the
            arcade-only Sonic the Fighters. There are only 4 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and 4 from Fighting Vipers
            in the Game.Com version.&amp;#xA;This game was one of the very last games to appear on the Sega Saturn in
            the United States and was directed by Yu Suzuki.

        <plot>Armstone City, year unknown. The Mayor decided to hold a fighting tournament with the grand finale being
            held on the top of the city tower, and the Vipers, young urban warriors decide to compete, each with their
            own goal on mind. All eight came from several backgrounds, like the hard-rocker Raxel, the orphan with a
            burning desire to meet his father Bahn, former gang leader Tokyo, queen of the catwalk Grace, the giant with
            an unknown past Sanman, construction worker and former marine trainee Jane, fashion designer to-be Candy and
            skater boy Picky, plus Mahler, someone with a score to settle with the Mayor.&amp;#xA;While based on the
            same Model-2 arcade board as Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers included several changes, such as a wall
            surrounding the battle area and equipping each fighter with a two-piece (chest and legs) armour that can
            only be broken with power hits. Once the armour is gone, the unfortunate fighter is more vulnerable to
            opponent hits, and damage can also be collected after hitting the wall or floor after a throw.&amp;#xA;Gameplay
            is also radically different from Virtua Fighter - noticeably faster, with combos done by fast button-mashing
            sequences sometimes on the same button, instead of the timed presses that require an additional push on the
            d-pad of the first title. Another new addition to gameplay is the Quick recovery, which allows a fighter
            that suffered a severe blow to quickly get on his feet, avoiding damage and allowing for a quick counter,
            but at the same time leaving him open for another blow if the opponent is fast enough. to react.&amp;#xA;Game
            modes include Arcade, Vs, Team Battle (best of 9) and Training. Game options allow the player to tweak the
            difficulty setting, number of rounds before a match winner is decided, size of life bars, if there&apos;s a
            time limit, if the order of opponents is random or predefined and between three game modes: Original (based
            on the arcade version), Arrange (gameplay tweaked for the Sega Saturn) and Hyper (allows Vipers to
            voluntarily drop their armour, allowing to perform special attacks at lightening fast speeds), Stage
            selection, and to change the disposition of the control pad to better suit the players&apos; style.&amp;#xA;Another
            mode, Playback, allows to see rounds previously saved by the player or fighting demos recorded by the AM#2
            staff, each with the ability to choose a camera. As usual with Sega&apos;s fighting ports, extensive
            bookkeeping is included, as well as a few hidden characters.

        <plot>This interactive movie puts a new twist on the Frankenstein tale: you are the monster! You have been
            falsely accused of murder and executed. However, the scientist Dr. Frankenstein (played by Tim Curry) has
            found a way to bring you back to life. You wake up in his laboratory, and your goal is to find out what
            exactly happened to you and what role Frankenstein played in your resurrection. Will you be able to return
            back to your former self?&amp;#xA;The game plays entirely from first-person perspective. You wander around
            the huge laboratory, looking for clues and solving puzzles. Sometimes events will happen in the game,
            triggered by careful research of Frankenstein&apos;s notes and other clues. The game features live actors
            filmed over pre-rendered backgrounds.

        <plot>Galactic Attack is a coin-op conversion of the Japanese arcade game RayForce (GunLock for European
            arcades). A top-down shooter, there are seven levels to play, ranging from battles in the atmosphere of
            planets to battling over mountain ranges, each with their own standard huge bosses at the end of each of
            these levels. The player takes control of a starfighter called the RVA-818 X-LAY, out to destroy any
            opposing forces.&amp;#xA;The story has the future of Earth governments gathering together to construct a
            massive super computer called Con-Human to help with the planet&apos;s environment, providing nutrients to
            the earth and caring for the ecosystem. However, a cloned human is linked with the system and makes
            Con-Human a sentient being. The system eventually becomes insane and starts to create natural disasters,
            wiping all nearly all of mankind and destroying the ecosystem, driving the survivors into space to develop
            colonies on other planets. Con-Human then makes Earth into a giant fortress and is assembling a massive
            armada to destroy the remaining survivors, but before it can attack, the survivors amass a first strike in
            order to reclaim the Earth.&amp;#xA;The goal is to fly around in the level, using the primary laser weapon
            to destroy various enemies flying in and out of the screen. Players can upgrade this weapon by collecting
            &quot;L&quot; icons floating around when enough enemies are destroyed. There is also a secondary weapon, a
            lock-on missile launcher, that has the ability to fire upon eight different ground enemies at once.

        <plot>Grand Slam Baseball was an innovative, albeit relatively low-key release from Virgin Interactive
            Entertainment in 1997.&amp;#xA;Not known for sports games, VIE released Grand Slam for Windows, Sony
            Playstation and Sega Saturn as the second title in its attempt to establish a mainstream sports line. The
            first title in the short-lived line was Power Play Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more
            title after Grand Slam&apos;s release, that being the sequel to the hockey game, also released in 1997.&amp;#xA;Grand
            Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and also offered full 3D play in
            software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions were 3D by default.&amp;#xA;Grand Slam introduced a few
            play mechanics to video game baseball that would later prove to be fixtures in the genre. The most notable
            in this area was the introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity and accuracy of
            pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This meter was later borrowed and made
            popular by titles such as EA&apos;s MVP Baseball. On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach
            was used. This was inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a swing&apos;s
            power with a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in.&amp;#xA;Other highlights amongst Grand
            Slam&apos;s feature set included:&amp;#xA;- A trade AI engine that would examine the needs of a team and
            decide if a proposed trade was in its best interest.&amp;#xA;- Catcher AI and pitch signals, helping a
            player learn how to pitch to each batter&apos;s strengths and weaknesses.&amp;#xA;- Attention to details and
            baseball flavor, such as players that would blow bubble gum bubbles during an at bat, light- hearted
            commentary, an All Star Break during season play (complete with a working voting ballot), and an in-game
            JumboTron scoreboard that would show animations after home runs.

            General charges in and warns them they are in grave danger. Seconds later, Imperial troops swarm into the
            inn and the heroes are forced to take flight along with this general.&amp;#xA;The fighting mechanic is

            the same way you&apos;d expect a normal beat-em-up to work), magical attacks and the ability to block. As
            you defeat enemies you gain experience points, with which you can upgrade your character between levels -
            sharing them between various factors such as strength, speed, constitution and magic resistance.&amp;#xA;Even
            more interesting however is the hugely branching storyline, which changes according to decisions you make
            (of which there are many) and which character you select to play with.&amp;#xA;Also of note is the fact that
            even in one-player mode there are always two of you on screen - you command the other character by changing
            his &quot;mood&quot; - aggressive, cowardly etc. - of which there are six. On top of this, it is possible to
            play the game as a more traditional beat-em-up with up to six players/bots, and in this mode you can play as
            any character that you have encountered during the main game mode.

            count out the mounted weapons. These include mines, concussion missiles, smart bombs, heat-seeking missiles,

            and a handicap that turns the screen upside-down, can also be collected.&amp;#xA;Five cars are available,
            with different statistics and built-in weapons. The initially weak weapon is soon replaced when you collect
            upgrade icons. To activate these, you have to complete a bonus stage after which you can also save your

            returns to the PC, Playstation and Saturn systems to battle tons of lowly enemies and the occasional

            series of games).&amp;#xA;True to the comic books, the Hulk relies on no other weapons than his massive
            muscles to punch, kick and crush his enemies. When he has accumulated enough gamma energy, he may use
            powerful special moves like a Vortex Spin or the Floor Hammer. Rare bonus items also allow the Hulk to
            summon one of the four Pantheon team members Atalanta, Ulysses, Ajax and Hector to assist in the thick of
            battle.&amp;#xA;Most levels include at least one arch-enemy, such as Piecemeal, Trauma &amp; Lazarus or the
            U-Foes. Luckily, the Hulk&apos;s regenerative powers allow him to regain health slowly. Little seems to be

            (Easy or Hard), and the Oracle provides clues to help along the way.&amp;#xA;The graphics for the puzzles
            are designed in an Egyptian or Mesopotamian style. Music plays in the background to provide atmosphere, but
            it can be turned off, if it gets repetitive. The basic layout is a hexagon around an Oracle&apos;s well.
            There are three doors on the outside of the hexagon, and the first one is where you begin the game. In each
            room is a puzzle you have to solve to get a jewel which must be taken back to the Oracle&apos;s well.&amp;#xA;The

            Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons: projectile and energy guns, unguided and guided missiles,
            and other special weapons. Destroyed enemies reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups,
            which recharge shields or rearm weapons.&amp;#xA;After a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack
            with more powerful weapons and replace the mech&apos;s armor.&amp;#xA;Between the missions, rather humorous
            live-action cutscenes (starring English actors sporting thick Russian accents) continue the story.

            itself is not all that much different from the first game however and doesn&apos;t really expand the RPG

        <plot>Magic Carpet is a first-person perspective game, in which you are a mage who flies on a, well, magic
            carpet and casts spells. The game has 50 levels, called &quot;worlds&quot;; each of those is set in a sea
            terrain with several mountainous islands. Your goal on each level is to amass enough mana within your castle
            to &quot;restore the equilibrium&quot; within the world. Once this happens, you can head to the next level.&amp;#xA;To
            collect mana, you have to find it (it is represented by golden spheres) and cast a specific spell to make it
            &quot;yours&quot;. To collect this mana, you have to use a special spell to raise a castle of your own out
            of the ground. A balloon will appear over the newly created castle; it will proceed to fly around the level
            and collect &quot;your&quot; mana. Initially, your castle will be small and won&apos;t be able to hold much
            mana, so you&apos;ll have to keep casting the &quot;castle&quot; spell at it to make it bigger.&amp;#xA;The
            levels typically have monsters and rival mages in them. Not only they can hurt you with their attacks, but
            killing them is often necessary, as upon death they will release some of the mana you need to complete the
            level. To attack your enemies, you have a variety of spells at your disposal: fireballs, lightning bolts and
            meteors.&amp;#xA;There are also many other spells available to you - they allow you to heal yourself,
            surround yourself with a protective shield, teleport around, summon a skeleton army, or even modify the
            terrain by creating volcanoes and splitting landmasses. Not all spells are available to you from the
            beginning, though.&amp;#xA;Throughout all the levels, you are on your flying carpet, which can move in 3
            dimensions. You can bring up a top-down map at any time.

            came along, special versions were created to take advantage of 3D texturing. While not QUITE as replayable
            as Mechwarrior, it&apos;s nonetheless a classic.&amp;#xA;If you want them now, get the Titanium Edition,
            which is 3D accelerated.

            can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This

            menu:&amp;#xA;1. &amp;quot;Hot Spots&amp;quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points
            (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.&amp;#xA;Powerup icons appear
            randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &amp;quot;on-fire,&amp;quot;
            enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players
            to the ground.&amp;#xA;&amp;quot;Juice Mode&amp;quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x.&amp;#xA;&amp;quot;Tournament
            Mode&amp;quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all
            the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also

        <plot>Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but it differs from the

            the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works,
            Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by
            Crayden, one of the Empire&apos;s officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam
            the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his
            faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the

            role-playing. You don&apos;t have a party in the game: you control only Edge on his dragon, who is in fact
            the playable character in battles. You move around through the game&apos;s fully 3D world by flying on the
            dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot. During battles, you can shoot with Edge&apos;s
            gun, or use one of the many special attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move
            around to attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks. The dragon gets
            experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will be able to customize your dragon by assigning

            Skins game. The game features two 18 hole golf courses to play at. Both platform versions of this game
            include the Sawgrass golf course, with each also including a unique golf course of their own. The
            Playstation version includes the Spanish Bay links, while the Saturn version includes the Spyglass Hill
            course. When on the course, player select what club they want to use. They also can set the angle, pitch and
            backspin of the ball before taking a swing. They then have to aim where they want their shot to go. When
            shooting, players have to contend with the &quot;Target Arc&quot; power bar interface which effects the
            velocity and accuracy of each shot. This meter also factors the players risk in their shot by determining
            the degree of difficulty it would be to make the shot. Bold shots get rewarded while risky shots are not.
            The game also features TV style commentary and several different camera angles, including a picture in

        <plot>An enemy with the codename &apos;Quake&apos;, which is believed to come from another dimension, is using
            teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base
            only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter
            to Quake&apos;s realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of
            monsters, and exact revenge.&amp;#xA;id Software&apos;s followup to Doom and Doom II, &quot;Quake&quot; is a
            first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels
            themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and
            character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have
            an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.&amp;#xA;In
            single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct
            episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to
            a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id&apos;s
            earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.&amp;#xA;Unlike Doom&apos;s
            rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake&apos;s
            levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military
            base (with a technological &apos;slipgate&apos; as the level exit), later levels take place in environments
            inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through
            magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom&apos;s colorful environments, all Quake levels are
            dominated by earth colors.&amp;#xA;The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents
            armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights,
            ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The
            player&apos;s weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel. Besides a (bloodstained) axe,
            there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical
            energy.&amp;#xA;Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs.
            The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode.
            One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and
            skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game
            also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.

            dastardly schemes!&amp;#xA;Rayman is side-scrolling platformer starring the titular Rayman, a big-nosed chap
            with no arms or legs. Rayman can jump and use his hair to hover for a short period of time. He can also
            attack by throwing his fists, or winding up his fists for a more powerful punch. He can occasionally find
            special power ups that grant him unlimited flying power, giving him the ability to navigate through tricky
            mazes.&amp;#xA;Aside from the platforming action, the other notable feature of Rayman is its large, detailed
            and vibrant graphics, which have helped it to stand out from most other similar games in the genre.

        <plot>Return Fire is an unreleased Sega Saturn game, ported from the Panasonic 3DO. It is a top-down 2.5D action
            game, in which you control a variety of vehicles and shoot enemies. The Saturn version of the game was
            completed and was ready for release, but complications arose. Hitachi, manufacturers of the HiSaturn, noted
            that the game did not run correctly on their variant of the console, leaving the developers (Prolific)
            waiting for a HiSaturn console to test the game on. After this setback the game&apos;s publisher, Williams
            Entertainment, decided to avoid publishing games for the Saturn, and hence the project was effectively
            scrapped. Other versions of the game were released, however, including a version for the PlayStation. The
            full Saturn version of the game was leaked onto the internet in 2007. It was also reviewed by several
            publications at the time and given a relatively high score.

        <plot>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the
            original, you are competing against thirteen other &quot;Road Rashers&quot; who will stop at nothing to win
            1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best
            to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you
            trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place.&amp;#xA;There
            are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of
            these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there
            are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and
            you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many
            times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are
            riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times -
            but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash
            cup.&amp;#xA;There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and
            Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to
            pick bikes from a different bike class.&amp;#xA;If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can
            choose the game&apos;s Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money
            involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if
            you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick,
            you will always start in the last place.&amp;#xA;The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the
            outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including
            Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game&apos;s
            options menu.

        <plot>Robo Pit is an arena fighter, plain and simple. Well, maybe not so simple. When you start your game, you
            have to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your
            starting choices are purely cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed
            and mobility of your fighter, as well as its special attack.&amp;#xA;Once you&apos;ve created your robotic
            brawler, it&apos;s time to start climbing the ranks. To progress, you have to fight the robot that&apos;s
            occupying the rank above yours. Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The game
            continues on in this fashion until you&apos;ve bested all of the other combatants. However, a few
            curve-balls are thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there are several different arms you
            can acquire; from swords and shields to cannons and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more
            effective (i.e. damaging) they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of &quot;boss&quot; robot is put in
            your way. These &quot;bosses&quot; use special weapons that only they have access to. Until you pound them
            into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can be incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making
            the rest of the fighters, save number one, a breeze. As an added bonus, you can even save your
            cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend&apos;s house for some one-on-one let&apos;s-see-who-has-the-best-robot
            fighting goodness!&amp;#xA;The arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up
            different layout and obstacles to take cover behind or use to get the drop on your opponent. They also have
            ledges, and like most fighting games a ring-out means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it&apos;s
            simple, but effective. Square and circle attack with the left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers
            your special (which has to charge of course). Of course different weapons have different ranges and timing,
            which will also improve the more you use them.

        <plot>A collection of three of Sega&apos;s most popular arcade games of the 1980s, translated for the Sega
            Saturn - Outrun, After Burner II and Space Harrier.&amp;#xA;In Outrun, get behind the wheel of your Ferrari
            and reach the checkpoints in time. Choose your destination as the road forks, and make sure you make it to
            the finish line before the timer reads zero.&amp;#xA;After Burner II allows you to fly the most feared jet
            fighter in the skies - the SSF-14 - and annihilate the enemy. With two Vulcan guns, heat seaking missiles
            and an afterburner, as well as support from the crew of the aircraft carrier Sega Enterprise, the object is
            to shoot the enemy from the sky - before they get you.&amp;#xA;Space Harrier is a shoot &apos;em up set in a
            fantasy future world. Armed with a gun and a jet pack, it is your job to rid Dragonland of the demon
            Absymbel and his evil forces.

        <plot>Sega Rally was a major success in the arcades, bringing rally-style racing to the masses before the Colin
            McRae games. Four detailed tracks have been created, with a succession of stomach-churning bends and jumps,
            and you can choose from 3 different cars. As well as the main championship, there is a time-trial mode
            featuring a ghost car to beat, so you always know how your run compares with your best-ever. Two machines
            can be linked for multi-player action. The handling of the cars is unrealistic, to put the focus on action
            and instant playability.

        <plot>After Virtua Racing, Daytona USA and Sega Rally, yet another classic SEGA arcade racer (this time, from
            the Model 2C CRX architecture) is converted for home users. After open-wheel, stock and rally cars, Sega
            took on the popular European Touring Car races (factory models modified for racing), featuring four real
            models (Alfa Romeo 155V6TI, Toyota Supra GT, AMG Mercedes C-Class and Opel Calibra V6) as well as some
            hidden cars. Some models feature four-wheel drive (easier to control on sharper turns) while other only have
            rear-wheel drive (forcing the player to calculate turns properly so the car doesn&apos;t skid). Because of
            this, gameplay is notoriously tighter and less forgiving than in any of the previous titles by Sega.&amp;#xA;Like
            with other Sega arcade ports, this home versions features both an &quot;Arcade&quot; and a &quot;PC&quot;/&quot;Saturn&quot;
            mode (the biggest difference being the time constraints and inability to use tweaked cars in arcade) with
            the usual Championship (three races in a row) and Time Attack modes, and a 2P split-screen race is also
            available. There are three tracks, plus one more as the final race (as usual with contemporary Sega arcade
            racers), and two viewpoints (behind and front bumper) are at the disposal of the player.&amp;#xA;As usual,
            there are additional modes, tracks and cars to be unlocked for those proficient in the game.&amp;#xA;Another
            feature was the &quot;Global Ranking&quot; mode, where players of either version could e-mail Sega of Japan
            a password containing his times, and compare them to the World&apos;s finest players, as well as in special
            one-day only &quot;Global Net Events&quot;.

            one for passing to teammates and one for lobbing. But simple doesn&apos;t mean limited since a couple of
            things are not explained in the manual and you&apos;ll have to figure them out yourself, which can take some
            time.&amp;#xA;You can choose between dozens of national teams from all over the world. Player names are made
            up since there&apos;s no Fifa license or anything but they&apos;re editable if you feel like correcting
            that. Game modes include Exhibition, Tournament, League or World Cup. You can play either versus the CPU,
            vs. up to 2 human players or even coop (2 humans vs. the CPU or other 2 humans).

        <plot>Set in a world of fantasy and magic, Shining Force III places you in the boots of a young general,
            fighting to preserve the peace in your world. The story starts out as the Emperor is abducted from within
            the city of Saraband, and you must go on the run with your king, who is suspected of being the mastermind
            behind the abduction. Of course, things are not as they seem, and you will be taken through a web of lies
            and deceit in your quest to prove the King innocent.&amp;#xA;The game is very similar in style to the
            earlier Shining Force titles, so anyone who&apos;s played them will be comfortable with the game, though
            likely they&apos;ll also be happy to find the game graphically overhauled, with a 3-D landscape and 3D
            characters during the battle animations. As ever the main game is controlled like a traditional RPG, with
            you controlling the main character, talking to NPC&apos;s and searching various items. However, the main
            selling point of the Shining Force series has always been its battle sequences.&amp;#xA;The combat system is
            amended from the earlier titles, with a new and unique &quot;friendship&quot; system, whereby the more two
            characters work together (helping each other out, healing each other etc.) the closer they bond, and they
            will start to give each other bonuses on the battlefield. Other traditional features, such as the
            rock-paper-scissors nature of the weapons (sword beats axe, axe beats spear, spear beats sword etc.) and the
            terrain effects (someone hiding in a forest is going to get better protection than someone on an open road)
            remain fully intact, and anyone who&apos;s played the earlier titles in the series will likely be very
            comfortable with the combat system.&amp;#xA;It should be noted that this is actually the western conversion
            of Shining Force III: Episode I, and was therefore only the first episode in an intended series of three.
            Unfortunately the other two titles were never released outside of Japan, so most western gamers were only
            able to experience a third of the storyline.

            Eclipse for the 3DO. Gameplay is pure arcade-style shooter. You can view the game from a behind-the-ship
            perspective, or an in-cockpit perspective, but the scrolling is on rails. You can only travel in one
            direction. In each of the 9 missions you will find wave after wave of enemy ships, and a powerful boss ship
            at the end.&amp;#xA;The story in this game is told through a series of full-motion video clips. In addition
            to between-level scenes, FMV messages from your squad mates appear from time to time while you play the
            game.

        <plot>While visiting Flicky Island, Sonic notices that the Flickies, his small, feathered friends that can
            travel between parallel worlds, were captured and turned into badniks (the robot enemies of Sonic) by Dr.
            Robotnik in his never-ending quest for the Chaos Emeralds. Seven levels separate Sonic from the final
            showdown with Robotnik.&amp;#xA;Sonic 3D was the last Sonic title released for the Mega Drive, the only
            platforming presence of the blue blur in the Sega Saturn, and one of his rare appearances in Personal
            Computers. The title, considering the era it was released, is somewhat misleading, as instead of full blown
            3D graphics it uses an isometric view where Sonic can move not only forwards and backwards, but also left
            and right.&amp;#xA;Gameplay is much slower when compared to other games in the series, and the number of
            badniks is reduced to five in each section. As usual, when Sonic destroys one badnik, an animal leaps free
            from its insides, but this time Sonic has to pick him up and lead them to an interdimensional ring. While
            they can be taken one by one, exploring the level with all five allow the player to reach for otherwise
            inaccessible continue tokens.&amp;#xA;Unlike all other previous games, time isn&apos;t a requirement: if the
            player completes a level in more than 10 minutes, it would only mean there would be no time bonus at the
            end. Finally, to collect all seven Chaos Emeralds, Sonic first must find Tails or Knuckles and offer them at
            least 50 rings.

        <plot>Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny
            aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the
            huge, evil Monstars.&amp;#xA;The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to
            fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The
            basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.&amp;#xA;Successful
            completion of the minigames upgrades your character&apos;s abilities on the court. There are several - one
            involves finding MJ&apos;s basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines
            games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.&amp;#xA;The
            multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one
            team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same
            team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game.&amp;#xA;The Tunes roster is made up of
            Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E.
            Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and
            Nawt.&amp;#xA;There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty
            self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that&apos;s similar to stamina. Throughout the course
            of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.&amp;#xA;The
            closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played
            multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while
            the rest of the team is substituted in and out.&amp;#xA;There is no real way to progress in the game as it
            does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.

            following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to
            crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being &quot;convinced&quot; to join them
            in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting
            edge technology.&amp;#xA;A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the
            Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are
            texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls
            the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy
            boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, and must keep moving at all times. Two points of
            view are available: behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE
            flight). By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by
            combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.&amp;#xA;One
            of the defining features of the game is using the laser (basic weapon) to terraform the map. As the game map
            is composed by tiles, some with higher or lower vertexes, can be leveled by simply firing repeatedly at the
            same area. This allows players to strategically avoid heavy defense turrets by simply collapsing a hill, or
            destroy an heavier turret by simply burrowing the ground beneath it.&amp;#xA;The player starts the game with
            three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game over, but as there isn&apos;t a
            profile for each pilot (like in Tie Fighter), the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.

            from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up those of the same color is not enough. To break
            the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to
            the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they&apos;ll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a
            power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other
            configuration. But the ultimate attack is breaking power gems in chain.

            also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine

            running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.&amp;#xA;You are
            competing against other Theme Parks, so don&apos;t let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success
            in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important,
            ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.&amp;#xA;It can be played in three modes -

        <plot>Vampire Savior is the 3rd in the Darkstalkers series. It plays much the same as the first, but features
            better animation, more playable characters, and a deeper storyline. Jedah, the &quot;Lord of Vampire&quot;,
            has summoned all of the Night Warriors to his realm to be assimilated into his being. Of course, this serves
            as a great excuse to have more one-on-one fights... Play as Jedah, B. B. Hood, Q-Bee, Lilith, Demitri,

        <plot>Cast as one of two brave cops, players of Virtua Cop are charged with bringing down an evil crime
            syndicate that is running riot in some unspecified town. Dropped into a series of locations, one or two
            players must arm up and shoot their way through three death filled levels, in an attempt to restore peace
            and order. Played from a first person perspective view, players can use keys or joypad, to aim and fire at
            the multitude of sharp shooters who come gunning for them.&amp;#xA;Starting the game armed with just a
            trusty old six-shooter, players can pick up more powerful, state-of-the-art weapons -- such as machine guns
            and shotguns -- as they progress. As these are hidden away in crates and the like, finding these weapons is
            an important part of the game and they can give players extra firepower when they most need it. In
            particular, such weapons can be extremely useful when trying to take on the customary end-of-level bosses.
            Made of stern stuff, you&apos;ll need all the help you can get in dispatching them off to hell.

            freedom. Each fighter has his own style, from the lightning fast attacks of Pai to the powerful slams of
            Jeffry.&amp;#xA;Home port of Sega&apos;s popular Model 2A arcade vs. fighter released in 1995. Game modes
            include classic arcade mode, 2P vs mode, Expert mode (where the computer character progressively learns and
            counters players&apos; technique), Ranking Mode (similar to Arcade, but at the end, a fighting style
            analysis is shown based on number of specials and time to knock down an opponent), Team Battle Mode (two
            teams composed of five fighters go against each other, the first to beat five characters being the winner)
            and Watch mode (allows choosing two fighters and then see them fighting). Both VF2 and VF2.1 (a tweaked
            version available only in Japan) modes are included. Gameplay keeps the same style from the first game,
            adding more moves to each fighters&apos; roll. Using a three-key layout (block, kick and punch, being
            possible to assign button combinations to the extra keys) the player is able to control their fighter,
            aiming to knock or push the opponent outside the rink inside the time limit. Combo moves range from the
            quickest, which require the player to push up to five buttons quickly, to strong moves that require more
            button presses along d-pad nudges to be successful. As with the previous game, fighting is realistic (except
            the physics-defying leaps), and each fighter has nothing but their body to harm the opponent.&amp;#xA;While
            in comparison with the arcade version some parts took a hit on graphical quality (such as the texture
            details and backgrounds), the game uses the Saturn High-Resolution mode and flowing 60-fps to bring the
            arcade experience home.

        <plot>Winter Heat is the home conversion of the DecAthlete (also known as Athlete Kings) sequel, replacing
            decathlon by Winter sports. Competition (in Arcade, Saturn or Practice modes) includes 11 events featuring
            eight athletes of different nationalities - Li Huang, Karl Vain, Joe Kudou, Ellen Reggiani, Aleksei Rigel
            and Rick Blade are joined by B.B. (replacing Jef Jansens, who appears as a secret athlete) and Johann
            Stensen (instead of Femi Kadiena).&amp;#xA;The game is a typical Winter-sports game, in the line of those
            released by Epyx but with a more arcade feel. The events include:&amp;#xA;1. Speed Skiing: A simple dashing
            event where the goal is to descend the hill as fast as possible (in speeds over 200 km/h). Action is reduced
            to mash the button to gain speed.&amp;#xA;2. Ski Jumping: Composed by four parts: The run up (mash the
            button to gain speed), the jump (selecting the angle), the flight (mash the button to gain extra length) and
            the landing (pressing the action button too early will lose valuable meters, too late will cost the jump).&amp;#xA;3.
            Downhill: A simplified version of the real downhill event. It&apos;s impossible to miss the gates, and the
            challenge is to get a strong start-up, keep a straight path not losing speed hitting the fences and hitting
            the action button to jump hills perfectly.&amp;#xA;4. Short Track Speed Skating: A straightforward event
            where the directional pad controls the direction of the athlete along the speed button to control the pace.
            As the event runs for over 40 seconds, it&apos;s possible to hold second position, making the opponent cut
            air resistance which allows the player to reach fastest speeds with less button presses.&amp;#xA;5.
            Skeleton: The first event in the ice tunnels, it requires a fast run-up followed by a strong entrance in the
            tunnels. By pressing the action button it&apos;s possible to slow down the sled and make more controlled
            turns, or the athlete can fall from it, which not only loses time but also requires a small run-up.&amp;#xA;6.
            Slalom: Just like the Downhill, it&apos;s impossible to miss a gate in the Slalom. After an initial sprint
            the player has to press the action button to approach each flag in the best way possible. Hitting the button
            too early or too late will make the athlete hit the flag, losing valuable time.&amp;#xA;7. Aerial: An event
            similar to the Ski Jump. Instead of offering a &quot;click-along&quot; version, the player starts by setting
            the difficulty of the jump, and then three parts follow: in the run-up, the player sets the speed by mashing
            the speed button, followed by the jump which sets the strength (by pressing the action button) and when the
            athlete leaves the launch ramp, the player must mash the speed button once again to complete the jump. To
            complete a jump, the player must fill each section of the jump bar by making enough button presses&amp;#xA;8.
            Bobsleigh: In all similar to the Skeleton, except there&apos;s no option to slow down.&amp;#xA;9. Speed
            Skating: Another simple button-mashing event but with a twist: speed must be controlled on the turns, or the
            athlete will slip out losing a few seconds in the process. The speed can be controlled by a color graph
            above the power bar.&amp;#xA;10. Snowboard: A mix between the Slalom and Downhill. There are several gates
            to be passed, plus two jumps. Unlike the other two events, it&apos;s possible to miss a gate, which carries
            a one second penalty for each missed.&amp;#xA;11. Cross Country:&amp;#xA; The stamina-influenced event.
            There&apos;s a long track with some hills that can be taken for advantage, as during downhill slopes it&apos;s
            possible to gain a lot of speed without losing stamina.

            control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time
            limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends
            immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single
            attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.&amp;#xA;There&apos;s
            a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings
            and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as
            ropes and girders.&amp;#xA;There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land
            and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be
