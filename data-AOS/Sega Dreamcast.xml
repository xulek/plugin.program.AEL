        <plot>4 Wheel Thunder is the off-road racing sequel to the popular power-boat racing game, Hydro Thunder. In
            this game, players race around two types of courses; huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks. All in
            all, there are 24 areas in which to race, including various day/night, rain/sunshine variations. The game
            includes the standard championship, practice race, and 2-player modes.&amp;#xA;The thunder series of games
            is unique in that the key to winning the race lies not in careful steering and braking, but in finding the
            &amp;quot;boost&amp;quot; power-ups that lie around the tracks. Each boost icon adds a few seconds of time
            to your boost meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of his or her truck
            dramatically. Without the boost power-ups, the player has no hope of winning a race.

            multi-player option. The Dreamcast, PC, and Macintosh versions can compete against each other in 4 player
            online races.&amp;#xA;In addition to the on-line mode of play, there is a single player career mode. The
            career mode gives you a small allotment of money with which to purchase a truck. You then can compete in
            races to earn more money for more trucks or performance parts for your current truck.

        <plot>90 minutes is a traditional action football game, featuring 7 leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy,
            Spain, plus an assortment of clubs from around the world) and national teams. While there are no team
            licenses, most players feature real names and there&apos;s also a player and team editor, allowing to change
            name and number of players, who&apos;s in each national team, as well as creating teams from scratch,
            including its players.&amp;#xA;Gameplay follows the norms of the genre - A to pass, B to throw a high lob, X
            to shoot, Y to change players, with the triggers to perform modifiers (though passes and lob shots) and
            sprint, although these can all be changed in the options. The player can also assign special tactics to each
            direction on the d-pad to adapt quickly according to the flow of the game.&amp;#xA;Game modes include the
            usual - World Championship (based on the world cup), as well as national leagues and cups (as well as a
            customizable cup), with secret teams waiting to be unlocked by those who win them, exhibition and training.
            Options are also the usual on these kind of games - change half lenght (3,5 or 10 minutes), opponent level
            and game speed. At gametime, players can also choose the weather, time of day, and between 10 cameras. There
            are six stadiums to choose from, inspired by venues such as the old Wembley Stadium, the Nou Camp or the
            ArenA in Amsterdam.

            second entry in Sega&apos;s Advanced Daisenryaku series, with gameplay very similar to that of it&apos;s
            16-bit predecessor, changing some details and using 3D animations for the combat cutscenes. The game uses a
            hex-based map and features fog-of-war, weather, unit experience, unit upgrading, supply, and other common
            strategy wargame features. Unlike the previous game, three campaigns are available instead of one. Japanese,
            as well as United States forces can be commanded now in addition to German units. The scenarios that are
            played during a campaign can change depending on the battle results - a successful player may invade North
            America for example. There are also ten scenarios with pre-set forces separately available for selection in
            Standard Mode, during which the control of all involved armies can be switched to a human player.

        <plot>Welcome to the Gunship Elite. Sorry to rush you out of training school, but we have full confidence in
            your abilities. You are fighting for the future of our cultures and the heritage of your Arikhan warrior
            ancestry. The Alliance is being invaded by the Sektar and their bloodthirsty allies, the Morgoths. While for
            years we have held them, their numbers are wearing us down. We must take the offensive soon. That is where
            you come in...&amp;#xA;Bang! Gunship Elite is an action game where you shoot a lot of enemies all by
            yourself, in the vein of Wing Commander or Freespace, but with the action turned up and tactics turned down.
            Add spectacular graphics, lots of &quot;power-ups&quot; (dropped by dead enemies or left in space by your
            supply ships), and you have a pretty good looking shooter. The game is mouse driven with keyboard inputs for
            things like speed and weapon selection. The plot is your typical &quot;fight against all odds&quot; story.

            your racket didn&apos;t touch it. Add the fact that it&apos;s pretty tough to judge distance and you have

            it cheap enough. The problem is that you probably won&apos;t find it cheap enough since this was never

            gain substantially more points.

        <plot>Charge &apos;N Blast is a shooting game where you play as one of three marines who have to rid the earth
            of alien scum. The gameplay is similar to Cabal, you move left and right dodging enemies while charging up
            you weapons to blast them away.&amp;#xA;There are three different marines you can choose from, each with
            their own set of weapons. As usual there is the balanced character (Johnny Rock), a weaker but faster one
            (Pamela Hewitt) and a slower but stronger one (Nicholas Woods).&amp;#xA;You can choose to play in one player
            mode, time attack or two player mode. The missions are broken up into small areas where you have to kill all
            enemies before moving on to the next area. Each mission ends with a boss character such as a giant insect or
            a Godzilla-like monster.&amp;#xA;Use the X, Y or B buttons to choose a weapon, press A to charge and shoot
            and aim with analog stick. There are different types of weapons that can be used on the different types of
            enemies. For example the single missiles for far away targets and torpedoes for underwater enemies.&amp;#xA;You
            can fire your weapon continuously, but this doesn&apos;t do as much damage compared to a fully charged shot.
            Charging each shot means you have to aim a little more carefully, but you&apos;ll especially need this in
            the later levels. You can dodge enemies with the L and R buttons.

            them. Blocks will fall when those under them are cleared, which can create chains for more points.&amp;#xA;The
            game includes three different play modes. First is a standard endless mode where play continues until the
            player is overwhelmed by the blocks. Second is a versus mode for two players. Last is a puzzle mode where
            the player is given a set field, a set sequence of drops, and a specific goal such as clearing all the gems
            or achieving a chain of a certain length. The puzzle mode has the player rescuing Cleopatra&apos;s friends

        <plot>An unusual game for SNK since they are renowned for their 2D fighting games. Cool Cool Toon at first

            see it&apos;s got it&apos;s own unique style that to be honest isn&apos;t exactly the best system out there.
            The game is tricky to play due to the positioning of the buttons that you have to do using the analogue
            controller and at times impossible to judge what is the next button to press. But it&apos;s not all bad. The

        <plot>Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way
            through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver
            passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians
            (which can&apos;t be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to
            their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the
            distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short.&amp;#xA;In
            the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers.
            While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give
            extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his
            destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left,
            as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a
            very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged.
            While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost
            to speed up more quickly.&amp;#xA;Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where
            specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the
            usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a
            license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from
            the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from.
            The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a
            soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).

            appeared in the vision, and falls towards the frozen tundra below.&amp;#xA;In the middle of a raging
            blizzard, Laura opens her eyes to find herself inside a mountain cabin. She was saved by Kimberly, one of
            the passengers of the wrecked plane. 10 days have passed since the crash but Laura can remember nothing, not
            even her name. The door of the cabin opens and one of the terrorists enters. While Kimberly and Laura stare
            in horror, he transforms into a hideous monster. He is not the only one. Other crash survivors and locals
            have mutated into terrifying monstrosities and attacked people. Is there anyway to survive this living
            nightmare? At present it is shrouded in mystery.&amp;#xA;D2 combines classical survival horror exploration
            and first person combat with a RPG typical experience/level system. You play the mysterious heroine Laura,
            stranded in a vast snowy landscape after a plane crash and struck with amnesia about the last 10 days. The
            3d engine allows you to freely move around the world, pilot snow mobiles, hunt for food or even capture
            photos. You will meet a variety of people and have to fight gruesome creatures and dangerous monsters. As
            the story advances you slowly regain your memory and unfold a terrifying plot about the end of the world.

        <plot>Three years ago a brilliant scientist disappeared while researching a new form of energy. The government

            reports of Dr. Kirk&apos;s good health and nearly finished research came in. A special forces team is sent
            to the doctor&apos;s private island laboratory to extract him and his research, but they are totally

            in the past.&amp;#xA;Dino Crisis is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay
            to its sister series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and
            ammo with which to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to
            open locked areas. Unlike Resident Evil games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and
            will instead find &quot;plugs&quot; that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the
            complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide
            what items are really needed. In another change from Resident Evil, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the
            camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest
            dinosaur is smarter than the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow
            her through doors.

            pod that protects them from enemy bullets and that can be launched as an offensive weapon in a move called
            &quot;dash. Keeping the fire button pressed will launch a more powerful hyper shot.&amp;#xA;To score points,
            the player can destroy chains of enemies in quick succession or soak up chains of bullets. Hyper Soaking
            makes the player invulnerable to bullets, but drains the Obvious Energy gauge if not enough bullets are

            like a big brother to him, raising the boy throughout his life.&amp;#xA;Now Rock is a teenager, and Terry is
            a man in his 30s, and both are about to come together in a new clash...new faces and old come together for

        <plot>Giant Killers is a text-based football management game, and as such the focus of the game is on the
            statistics and not on the action. Based on the 1999 UK season, the game allows the player to take control of
            any team in the UK&apos;s Premier league, Divisions One, Two or Three, or the Conference league. The game
            has three levels of difficulty. In the easy level the player&apos;s club has a wealthy benefactor who makes
            £25m available, in the medium setting £25m is still available, but two other clubs in the league also
            receive the same cash injection. In the hard mode there is no extra cash available. Having started the game
            and selected a team, the player is presented with the game&apos;s main menu. The options here allow the
            player to access a quick overview of the club&apos;s status, fixtures, results and league tables. The main
            menu also allows the manager to access the transfer market, where players can be bought and sold, and the
            manager&apos;s diary, where messages, such as the success or failure of a transfer bid, are received. It is
            through the manager&apos;s diary that game-time is advanced through to the day of the next match. On match
            day the player selects their team from the available squad, and decides the formation to be used and tactics
            - long ball, direct or passing - for the upcoming match. The game offers many standard formations as well as
            offering the player the chance to create their own. Having decided how the game is to be played, the player
            starts the match. As this is a management game, there is no game play video to watch; instead the player
            receives match highlights as though on a teleprompter. At any time during the game the player can pause the
            match and change the team&apos;s tactics and / or make a substitution. At the end of the match the player
            can view a range of stats on individual performance e.t.c.The game is entirely mouse controlled, though a
            keyboard is required when entering names for save games.

            the main gun is fired. Holding the button activates the Reflect Force. The B button fires a bomb from a
            limited stock to become temporarily invincible. Power-ups can be collected to increase the bomb and life
            stock or enhance the main gun&apos;s fire power.&amp;#xA;Scoring works by using the Reflect Force to repel
            enemy shots. Once the shots hit an enemy, medals appear in their place. When these are collected, the score
            multiplier increases.&amp;#xA;There are two game modes, arcade and score attack. Arcade plays just like the
            original coin-op game, and score attack lets the player choose a stage and fight for the highest score
            there. In this mode, the player has unlimited lives, however the score multiplier will reset once the player
            dies or uses a bomb.

            and a 3rd person view during battle. Controlling Ryudo, the player will explore various locations, locating
            townspeople and objects within an area to interact with. Towns and dungeons are displayed in the same
            manner, though dungeons tend to be mazes filled with monsters and towns tend to be friendly areas filled
            instead with conversation and shops. Any monsters present in these areas will be shown walking around.
            Walking over to and touching the monster in any way will activate a battle. If the monster notices the
            player approaching it is considered a normal battle, if Ryudo is able to approach undetected the player&apos;s
            party will gain the initiative in battle, if any party member besides Ryudo is approached by the enemy then
            the party loses initiative.&amp;#xA;In battle, each character is able to choose from a list of actions that
            include &quot;attack combos&quot; (standard attack command), Special Abilities/Magic, &quot;Critical Strike&quot;,
            Guard, Evade and Escape. Critical Strikes are weaker versions of attack combos with the advantage that they
            can block an enemy&apos;s action. This partly depends on the positions of the character on the action bar,
            displayed at the bottom of the screen, which shows each character (and enemy&apos;s) time to act within the
            battle. Some magic spells and special abilities are also able to block enemy actions, though they take
            longer to perform than normal attacks. Both combo attacks and critical attacks require the attacker to run
            up to the enemy in order to perform the action. This depends heavily on the character&apos;s individual
            movement as well as other characters acting as obstacles on the screen. Successfully defeating enemies in
            battle awards experience points, power points, magic points, gold and items.

            heralding the resurrection of Valmar.&amp;#xA;Ryudo is a &quot;GeoHound&quot;, a mercenary available for
            hire, usually for slaying monsters and recovering goods. Working with a talking bird named Skye, who sites
            on Ryudo&apos;s shoulder, they will &quot;do anything&quot; if the price is right One day Ryudo receives a
            job from a branch of the Church of Granas, they ask Ryudo to become a bodyguard for a young priestess named
            Elena during a prayer ceremony. During the ceremony, strange events occur requiring Ryudo to escort Elena on
            a journey towards the&amp;#xA;Grandia 2 is a 3D RPG, viewed from a top-down perspective for most of the game
            and a 3rd person view during battle. Controlling Ryudo, the player will explore various locations, locating
            townspeople and objects within an area to interact with. Towns and dungeons are displayed in the same
            manner, though dungeons tend to be mazes filled with monsters and towns tend to be friendly areas filled
            instead with conversation and shops. Any monsters present in these areas will be shown walking around.
            Walking over to and touching the monster in any way will activate a battle. If the monster notices the
            player approaching it is considered a normal battle, if Ryudo is able to approach undetected the player&apos;s
            party will gain the initiative in battle, if any party member besides Ryudo is approached by the enemy then
            the party loses initiative.&amp;#xA;In battle, each character is able to choose from a list of actions that
            include &quot;attack combos&quot; (standard attack command), Special Abilities/Magic, &quot;Critical Strike&quot;,
            Guard, Evade and Escape. Critical Strikes are weaker versions of attack combos with the advantage that they
            can block an enemy&apos;s action. This partly depends on the positions of the character on the action bar,
            displayed at the bottom of the screen, which shows each character (and enemy&apos;s) time to act within the
            battle. Some magic spells and special abilities are also able to block enemy actions, though they take
            longer to perform than normal attacks. Both combo attacks and critical attacks require the attacker to run
            up to the enemy in order to perform the action. This depends heavily on the character&apos;s individual
            movement as well as other characters acting as obstacles on the screen. Successfully defeating enemies in
            battle awards experience points, power points, magic points, gold and items.

        <plot>When the humans created artificial beings named &quot;gears&quot; in 22th century, they didn&apos;t expect
            that their creation will eventually turn against them. Because gears had no will of their own and could only
            obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel
            against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the
            Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet
            he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was
            immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another
            tournament, this time with a solid prize: five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner.&amp;#xA;&quot;Guilty
            Gear X&quot; is a follow up to Guilty Gear, and is also a 2D fighting game. There are now 16 characters
            available for you to choose. The battle system became more complicated, thanks to the variety of moves you
            can perform. Beside special attacks which you can execute if you build up your Tension Gauge by attacking or
            advancing towards your opponent, there is also a variety of defensing moves to perform. The instant kill
            moves are back from the previous game.

            who can create and control evil beings made of steel, and uses his power to terrorize the galaxy. On his

            Kairos II. Gunlord is a mixture of platforming and run &amp; gun gameplay in the spirit of Turrican. This
            includes exploring large and highly branched levels in search for items, bonus, power-ups and the exit. The
            game mechanics are very similar, with an assortment of weapons, which can be upgraded by finding power-ups,
            but only being able to have one main weapon. Gordian is also able to form a ball to move through narrow
            passages or attack. Additional weapons are a limited amount of smart bombs (huge energy swipes across the
            screen) and flexible beam, which uses up (self-restoring) energy.

            Fairbanks, and Michel Waters, receive invitations to the ghastly park. Filled with enthusiasm, Kevin, Randy,
            and Michel carelessly rush to Illbleed, leaving behind young Eriko. Eriko eventually heads to Illbleed to

            monsters populate each attraction as well, and each is programmed to attack and kill attendees. In addition
            to the robots, every room in an attraction is fitted with traps to surprise and hurt. If the player

            The four major sides to the conflict (American, British, German, Japanese) are all fighting one another over

            flight missions in which your American pilot will fight against the Axis forces and ally with the British.

            one of three rival teenage gangs who ride motorised inline skates and are tagging the streets with graffiti.
            There is a turf war going on between the gangs GG&apos;s, the Poison Jam, and the high-tech freaks, the
            Noise Tanks. The evil Rokkaku Corporation has the corrupt police in their grasp, and, headed by Captain
            Onishima, the cops are hell-bent on subduing the unruly teen protagonists. But there is light in the
            darkness: the underground DJ, &quot;Professor K,&quot; and his Jet Set Radio station keep tabs on what is
            happening on the streets of Tokyo-to, and soon our teens will have something much darker than the police to
            worry about.&amp;#xA;As one of the GG&apos;s, you skate through a variety of different levels, from busy
            streets to run-down rooftops and smelly sewers where you learn new moves, collect spray cans, and tag the
            streets with graffiti. New graffiti designs can be unlocked by finding &quot;Graffiti Souls&quot; in levels,
            by designing new graffiti yourself, or by going online and downloading any images you find while browsing
            the internet. Fight the rival gangs &quot;Poison Jam&quot; and the &quot;Noise Tanks&quot;, the evil
            mega-corporation Rokkaku and their police cronies in this fresh take on the platform genre, mixing
            traditional platform elements with skating similar to that of the Tony Hawk&apos;s Pro Skater games. Players
            are scored on their performance in a level, both on the level of graffiti attempted as well as optional tags
            and skating tricks. As the game progresses challenge maps open that test the player&apos;s ability to do

            two new levels based on New York. The story and order that you meet characters was modified to include these
            two levels. Both releases also have different unique soundtracks for these levels.

            on the story and gameplay presented in The King of Fighters &apos;99. This year&apos;s tournament is
            sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail
            the plans of potential NESTS agents K&apos; and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually
            is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of
            the tournament.&amp;#xA;The King of Fighters 2000 features a roster of 34 fighters plus 2 unlockable boss
            characters. The four-man teams and the striker system introduced during the previous year return in this
            year&apos;s tournament, with the striker system itself receiving significant improvement. One change in
            particular is the &quot;alternate&quot; striker system, where every fighter in the game now has another
            character linked to him or her that may be chosen instead of the normal character for striking purposes. For
            example, one may elect to use Iori Yagami&apos;s alternate striker instead of using Iori himself; in his
            case, the player could elect to choose and use his old teammates Mature and Vice for striker duty instead.
            Some characters also have hidden &quot;maniac&quot; striker with strange (but potentially useful) abilities.

            organization is once again standing in the participant&apos;s way; they have deployed their own team of four

            series. Counting the new characters (May Lee, Angel, K9999, Original Zero, Igniz) and returning fighters
            (such as Heidern and Goro Daimon), The King of Fighters 2001 has 40 normal characters and 2 boss characters
            to choose from. In terms of gameplay, the system used in The King of Fighters 2000 remains more or less
            unchanged with the exception of the striker system, which has been redeveloped since that last KOF release.
            The number of strikers you may have is now fully customizable; you can have as many as 3 characters assigned
            as strikers and one as a fighter, or assign all 4 of your characters as active fighters. The number of
            strikers and fighters can be changed after each battle. In addition, the amount of power you can store for
            special maneuvers and Desperation Moves increases with each character assigned as a striker. A fully active
            fighting team has only one Power Stock to play with, while a team that is striker-dedicated (save for the
            single fighter) can access up to four Power Stocks.

        <plot>Wicked Jester, a band of four, are headed for a Friday night gig at The Coventry, a rundown dive outside

            members: Pablo Ramirez, Andy Chang, Gabriel Gordo and Patrick Scott, stepping from their van, are startled
            by a voice from the shadows. She offers them four tickets to a circus -- tonight&apos;s the grand finale!
            Having nothing better to do, the four accept and the nightmare begins.&amp;#xA;Based on characters from
            comic book author Todd McFarlane, KISS Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child brings the horror and carnage of
            the Psycho Circus to the PC in a shooter format. There are two-dozen creatures to battle with and three
            classes of weapons to use, each with four specific types: melee (beast claws, thornblade, twister and
            punisher), common (zero cannon, magma cannon, windblade and scourge) and ultimate (stargaze, galaxion,
            spirit lance and draco). In addition to the weaponry, temporary power-ups and instant items such as health,
            attack and defense powers are available.

        <plot>Lack of Love (or L.O.L.) is an adventure / RPG hybrid based on the evolution of an alien being. In the
            beginning you are just born, but the alien world is harsh, and so you constantly have to improve yourself,
            learn new things and avoid being eaten by other animals. And to make your new life even harder, an alien
            robot race just discovered the planet and starts colonizing it. Surviving is obviously not easy...&amp;#xA;The
            game is played from an isometric perspective in front of detailed prerendered backgrounds. As you are an
            animal the game doesn&apos;t have any ingame texts - for solving riddles you are totally dependent on
            experimentation and careful observation of the environment. To reach the next state of evolution you will
            also need to help other beings - as a reward they will give you energy balls or new abilities required for
            further progress.&amp;#xA;Besides the usual actions like attacking / biting and talking (or better
            communicating) you have somewhat strange actions sleeping and urinating which are essential to the gameplay.

        <plot>1500 years after Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain&apos;s decision at the end of that game has
            finally defeated the human kingdoms and brought the world of Nosgoth under his control. Ruling from a castle
            built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a
            lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the &quot;insolence&quot;
            of receiving a new evolutionary &quot;dark gift&quot;, the growth of feathery wings, before his master had
            acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel&apos;s wings in a fit of
            range and banishes him into the Abyss. There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder
            God recovers Raziel&apos;s soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new
            creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it&apos;s
            underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...&amp;#xA;Soul Reaver is a 3rd person
            action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on
            Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel&apos;s
            shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel&apos;s
            can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift
            through the &quot;material&quot; world into the &quot;spectral&quot; realm at will... but must find specific
            locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to
            new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel&apos;s life energy at a constant rate.
            Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to
            defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability (&quot;dark gift&quot;) upon drinking it&apos;s
            soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through
            locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as
            well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain&apos;s personal sword
            (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon.&amp;#xA;The world is left
            open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access
            to certain areas however sometimes requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the
            player will need to solve in this quest are &quot;block puzzles&quot;, requiring the placement of certain
            large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach
            areas.

            completely designed for the holding of criminals. You are a synthetic lifeform sentenced for an eternity for
            a crime you didn&apos;t commit and in order to earn your freedom, you must compete against other prisoners
            in competitions in 10 different incarceration facilities. To compete in these competitions however, you must
            undergo a procedure that removes your legs and replaces it with a rolling sphere. There are seven different
            events to compete in which are Pursuit, Last Man Rolling, Race, King of the Hill, Run the Gauntlet, Tag, and
            Powerball that pit you not only against your fellow inmates and guards, but against the levels themselves.
            Run the gauntlet charges you with making it to a goal point within a time limit, all the while avoiding
            other warriors and obstacles such as flame throwers, spikes, and gun turrets. Pursuit is identical, but it
            adds the challenge of the arena crumbling away. Powerball has you collecting balls throughout the arena and
            throwing them at a goalpost before time runs out. Tag has you collecting a set number of tokens that have
            been scattered throughout the arena within a set time limit.

            puzzler coming to beloved Dreamcast straight from the Naomi arcade original. Musapey&apos;s is probably best
            described as a marsupial like creature. In a typical one-player game your marsupial is dropped onto the
            playing field, a collection of various colored cubes with a special cube called &apos;boss&apos; at the
            center of the mess. Your creature freely walks six sides of the playfield using a block it stands upon (you
            lay these blocks down with a press of a button) eliminating other blocks/rows to clear the playfield leaving
            only the boss block remaining. A time limit adds another layer of challenge. Eliminating blocks is simple,
            it&apos;s akin to a sandwich, say you have a yellow block, plop a red block at one end of the block and do
            the same at the other end (R,Y,R), the entire row will disappear. In addition any loose blocks hanging on
            that row will disappear as well. These extra blocks will add a few seconds back to the clock, quite handy.
            The game doesn&apos;t dictate the length of a row but the more blocks you eliminate the more your bomb gauge
            fills which yields a block that wipes out blocks in a set radius. Using gravity to take out multiple rows
            and gray blocks that have to transformed to be removed add another facet to the gameplay, elevating the
            simple premise into a deep game.

            improvements in graphics with higher polygon counts, more animations and 60 fps frame rate. AI has also been
            improved, and the controls allow for many more realistic moves. Player and team stats have been updated for
            the 2001-2002 NHL season. Game modes include Exhibition, Season (now optionally only of half length),
            Playoffs and, newly added, Tournaments. Players can be created and traded and rosters edited. Coaching
            controls allow setting of strategies and lines. The game includes a basic control mode that uses the face
            buttons for all actions, and an advanced mode that uses the trigger buttons to modify the actions of the
            face buttons, allowing for a higher variety of moves. The game includes play-by-play commentary by L.A.

            past few days due to memory loss. As the game progresses you will find a plot that twists and turns at every
            corner. For transportation, you use a &quot;Slider&quot; that you can control manually or set to auto-pilot
            to take you throughout much of Omikron. When given a choice of what to say to a person, your answers will
            almost always affect your future in the game and how people act towards you.&amp;#xA;Throughout the course
            of the game you may take on the role of up to 41 different characters through the use of a &quot;Soul
            Transfer&quot; spell. In most situations, even if you die, you will be &quot;virtually&quot; reincarnated
            through the next character that touches you. In your travels you must explore the vast city of Omikron. You
            may visit anywhere in the city that you wish to, even if it isn&apos;t important for finishing the game.&amp;#xA;An
            example of this freedom is when in the &quot;red light&quot; district of Omikron, you find a flyer about a
            &quot;prohibited&quot; concert that you may attend. If you go to the concert, the band will play a full
            length song for you. Also in this part of Omikron you can attend &quot;peep-shows&quot; and go visit the sex
            shops. All items are kept inside your SNEAK device on your wrist, 18 items may be carried at once and there
            is a transfer system set up so items can be stored and retrived at another station.&amp;#xA;Also, in
            Omikron, it is important that with each character you take them through combat training so you are at a
            higher fighting level. Although most of the game takes place in adventure mode there are two other modes
            available to use at certain points throughtout the game, shooting and fighting. In the fighting mode, your
            character knows a variety of moves and will have to fight off his opposition. In the shooting mode, you find
            yourself in a first-person perspective shooting after thugs mostly, although you will run into some more
            interesting enemies to shoot later in the game.&amp;#xA;As they say in Omikron, &quot;Who will you be after
            you die?&quot;

            half of the scales down and your half up. If that wasn&apos;t enough to worry about you also have to
            remember that your balls will change colour once a combination has been preformed. Of course the colour
            changing is always the same such as a red ball will change to a green ball and so on.

            matrimonial arrangements: it appears that the Sultan had promised his daughter to Assan&apos;s son, Rugnor,
            and later broke his promise by letting her marry the Prince. In the resulting turmoil, the Sultan is killed,

            find Rugnor, defeat him, and rescue his wife. Prince of Persia 3D is just what its title implies: an action
            platformer with puzzle-solving elements in the style of the previous Prince of Persia games, but set in a
            three-dimensional environment. The Prince still has to time his jumps, avoid deadly traps, interact with the

        <plot>Psychic Force 2012, the sequel to Psychic Force, is a one-on-one fighting game with a twist. The matches
            take place inside a giant floating cube. You are able to fly, using your psychic abilities, around a 3D
            arena with six walls. Each of the ten available characters, Might, Regina, Wendy, Emilio, Setsuna, Patty,
            Gudeath, Genshin, Carlo, and Gates, are controlled with three buttons: guard, weak attack and strong attack.
            The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using
            special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity
            of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health.&amp;#xA;Additionally, each fighter has its own
            unique moves, energy attacks and a weapon, which they use, mid-flight, to pummel their opponent. There are
            three main game modes: training, versus and a story mode using static anime-inspired images and in-engine
            cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about
            co-existence with humans. In the middle of this are several neutral psychics with ties to members in either
            group.&amp;#xA;The later PlayStation port, renamed to Psychic Force 2, adds the 3 missing characters from
            the first game (Genma, Brad and Sonia), the psy-expand mode where the player can play a series of special
            battles to learn other character attacks, and an anime intro video replacing the original in-game intro. It
            also lowers the overall difficulty of the CPU fighters and makes some control adjustments (for instance the
            shield can now optionally be enabled with a single button). Of course, the graphics were notably degraded.

            (other examples being Ikaruga and Border Down). As many other recently released shoot&apos;em&apos;ups, it
            combines basic arcade shooter gameplay with modern 3D graphics to liven up the genre. The level backgrounds
            as well as all enemies are modeled in full 3D, with the action taking place in a vertically scrolling
            two-dimensional plane which moves through the level.&amp;#xA;As most of the other new-style SHMUPs,
            Psyvariar 2 has a gimmick: getting close to enemies or shots without actually being hit is called &quot;buzzing&quot;
            and yields massive extra score. In addition, the player ship&apos;s rate of fire is rather slow by default
            and can be raised by shaking the ship left and right a few times and then keeping moving horizontally - as
            soon as the horizontal movement stops, the fire rate drops down to normal again.&amp;#xA;As in most other of
            the new Japanese style of shoot&apos;em&apos;ups, there are usually an extremely high number of enemy shots
            on the screen. All these factors combine to make learning precise control a central part of the game.

            multiplayer arena fighting with no story-driven singleplayer part - directly competing with Epic Games that
            did the same with the contemporary Unreal Tournament.&amp;#xA;The offline part takes the player through a

            general design of the game are much brighter and it shakes off the dominant shades of brown and grey the
            previous titles in the series were known for. The player&apos;s arsenal consists of new and familiar, but
            redesigned weapons, including a gauntlet (melee attacks) and a machine gun as the spawn weapons, a shotgun,
            plasma gun, lightning gun, rocket launcher, railgun and BFG. Each weapon has specific advantages, ranging
            from the amount of damage to reloading times and the ability to hit-scan opponents.&amp;#xA;The different
            arenas are also filled with health bubbles, complete sets of armour and armour shards, the well-known Quad
            Damage power-up, ammunition, and specials such as Mega Health, Haste, Invisibility, a powerful Battlesuit,
            and more. As with the other Quake games, it is known for its freedom in movement. Advanced players using
            techniques such as rocket jumping, strafing and circle jumping to quickly get around areas. The game offers
            more speed than Quake 2, but it is not as fast as the original Quake. Not everything was kept - the double
            jumping from the previous titles was removed for instance, but replaced with new tricks.&amp;#xA;The
            singleplayer part only serves as a diversion for the online multiplayer options, with modes such as duel,
            team deathmatch (TDM), capture the flag (CTF) and more. As with Quake II, the vanilla version of the game
            was eventually heavily tweaked by the players&apos; community with all-new tournament features (including
            voting, referees, banning, netcode updates), as it was used in professional Pro Gaming tournaments for
            almost ten years.

        <plot>Razor Freestyle Scooter is an extreme-sports style action game modeled around small, nimble scooters. In
            contrast to most games of this type, there is a story. A crazed giant robot has kidnapped your skating
            buddies. By completing skating challenges at the robot&apos;s sky fortress, you must rescue your friends.&amp;#xA;You
            skate around 3 large areas and attempt to perform wild tricks, collect scooter wheels, and earn bonus time.
            By completing an objective on all 3 areas, you unlock a sky fortress level in which you can rescue a new
            skater to control.&amp;#xA;Gameplay is based heavily on the Tony Hawk series of games. Tricks consist of
            button and direction presses, and can be strung together with grinds to create high-scoring combos.

        <plot>For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within
            months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on
            exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in
            the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost... magic. Now, their newest
            R/C cars really start to live!&amp;#xA;Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than
            28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket,
            a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a &quot;reversed&quot; (backwards) or &quot;mirror&quot;
            (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from.&amp;#xA;There
            are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There&apos;s a Single Race, where you
            complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where
            you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with
            live opponents. There&apos;s also a Time Trial, where you&apos;re alone on the track, and simply try to get
            as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you&apos;re free to drive around a track to learn its
            structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect
            stars situated in hard-to-reach places.&amp;#xA;In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are
            power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles
            to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which
            makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.

        <plot>Reel Fishing: Wild is a Dreamcast-exclusive entry in the fishing simulation series. It allows players to
            catch two dozen species of fish in 14 different locations all over the world, from Japan to North and South
            America to Oceania. The Dreamcast fishing rod controller is supported for realistic castings and reel-ins.
            The game starts in the fishing lodge, where players can check out a fish glossary, their catch list and
            their stock of lures, reels and lines and rods. Going for a round of fishing is done via the fishing
            notebook, which presents players with a series of challenges. At the start, only one location - a Japanese
            mountain stream - is unlocked. To unlock others, a certain number of a particular species must be caught.
            Catching fish not only opens up new locations, but also gives access to new types of lures, reels and lines,
            and rods, which in turn allow more successful fishing. A fishing session begins with a photo-realistic
            first-person view of the location created through combining digitized images with some animation, like for a
            waterfall or swaying trees, as well as disturbances of the water surface that hint at the best places for
            casting. Once the line is cast and a fish moves near the lure, the view switches to a 3D underwater view,
            showing fish, line, and hook in close-up. Baiting, setting the hook, and reeling in the catch are then done
            in this view.

        <plot>So Evil they even gave it a subtitle!&amp;#xA;The final installment of the Resident Evil series for the
            Playstation, Resident Evil 3 takes place during the events of Resident Evil 2. The midwestern town of
            Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks
            of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. As Jill &quot;master of unlocking&quot; Valentine (one of the two main
            protagonists of the original Resident Evil), you must find a way out of the zombie-infested remains of the
            city alive. Along the way, you&apos;ll interact with and receive help from three heavily armed Umbrella
            mercenaries who have also become stranded in Raccoon City thanks to the incompetence of their employer.
            Standing in the way of your group&apos;s last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens,
            homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and
            kill the survivors of the original Resident Evil, including Jill.&amp;#xA;A dramatic improvement over
            Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis possesses the same maneuverability as Jill allowing him to
            run (faster than you, in fact), use firearms (such as a rocket launcher), dodge attacks, and even move
            through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of that he still possesses the nigh
            indestructibility we&apos;ve come to know and... well, know from Umbrella&apos;s ultimate bio-weapons.&amp;#xA;Like
            its two predecessors Resident Evil 3 is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on
            pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by Alone in the
            Dark. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, improvements include
            auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows you to avoid enemy attacks by pressing a
            button a second before they strike. Another addition is Jill&apos;s ability to create different kinds of
            ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. Compared to
            Resident Evil 2, the amount of available ammunition and healing items has been significantly decreased,
            making the game more difficult. The variety of zombie citizens has also been made more diverse.&amp;#xA;The
            number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen
            resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at
            16 bits for Resident Evil 2). Another welcome addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as
            well as the door loading animation.&amp;#xA;The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill&apos;s
            possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one
            of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by
            beating the game with a high score.

            which the player can compete on with the 3rd being of the easiest difficulty and requiring less money to
            participate; the 1st being the most difficult one and needing a higher amount of money in order to
            participate. More money can be earned by winning the races and that in turn allows to buy new cars or
            upgrade the ones that are already in possession.&amp;#xA;Multi-Player - Multi-player mode supports up to 2
            human players that can compete in any of the available circuits with 4 more CPU controlled racers. The mode
            allows for either vertical or horizontal split screen.&amp;#xA;Quick Race - In Quick Race the player can

            the player must shake the maracas in the appropriate region with proper timing to progress. A standard
            controller can also be used if you do not have the maracas controller, which is sold separately.&amp;#xA;The
            music in the game comes from a wide variety of sources. Some of the songs are traditional samba music, while
            others are recognizable pop tunes, like &quot;Macarena&quot; and &quot;Tequila.

            player can also pick the month, time of day and weather in which he wants to fish. All these factors are
            calculated when it comes to determining what kind of fish he or she is likely to catch. To aid the player
            there&apos;s 100 different kinds of lures to fish with.&amp;#xA;The game is meant to be played with the
            special fishing rod controller.&amp;#xA;There are two game modes: free fishing and tournament mode. In the
            first you can do what you wish and try to improve on your own records. In the latter mode you have to
            compete against NPCs or another player. There are various tiers of difficulty.

            predecessor, is based on Rally racing. Rally racing is unique in that races take place on both race tracks
            and off-road courses. The courses in this game reflect this nicely. Some take place in the desert or forest,
            others take place in cities.&amp;#xA;The cars in this game are all actual rally cars, with manufacturers
            from Europe and Japan both well represented. You do not get to see very many of them at one time, however,
            since rally races are typically time-based events. In this game, you are not competing directly against the
            other cars, you simply have to have the best time through the course. So, during any race you will usually
            see a handful of other cars on the track.&amp;#xA;Sega Rally 2 contains several modes of play. The first
            mode is the simple arcade mode of play. Here, you race in 4 courses, one right after another. The second
            mode is the 10 year championship. In this mode you race on 16 courses, and can make modifications to your
            car between races. Finally, there is a 2-person split screen mode for head-to-head competition.

            logo, a Cinnabon-like swirl.)&amp;#xA;The object of the game is simple. A screen fills with multi-colored
            swirls, and then you must remove the whole screen. A swirl removed will also remove all neighboring swirls
            of the same color. Gravity affects the remaining swirls, and the whole mass contracts to the left of the
            screen as you remove more and more.&amp;#xA;Scoring is based on &quot;combos&quot;, or number of swirls
            removed simultaneously. Obviously, more swirls=higher points, but single swirls actually remove points. You
            have to play a balancing act between removing huge masses of swirls and being left with non-matching sets,
            or removing smaller sets and possibly missing out on a huge combo score.&amp;#xA;In a foreshadowing of the
            (hoped for) coming day of PC/video game on-line convergence, PC and DC owners can play against each other-
            via e-mail.&amp;#xA;PC owners can download the game for free, and Sega offers it in two varieties- the
            standard version, and (refreshingly) a small sound-free version for people who don&apos;t want to be online
            for a long time. A separate soundpack is available for those who opt to not get the whole set in one fell

        <plot>Sega Tetris is an officially licensed Tetris game originally made for arcades that can be played in both
            single player and multi player modes. The game uses polygonal graphics with animated backgrounds. As
            progress through the game is made these change and take the player to numerous different settings. When
            playing alone the game is very much true to the original Tetris but with some differences. The game is
            played with a joystick for moving the blocks around as they fall and two buttons to rotate them left and
            right. As the game&apos;s level is raised the speed of the falling block will also increase and since it&apos;s
            an arcade game it will reach a high pace relatively early. One addition to the game is a slot machine and
            the symbol it stops on depends on the number of lines cleared. By matching all the three wheels the player
            will get a large bonus. The two player versus mode adds special attacks to the gameplay and these are
            activated by clearing lines. Clearing two lines will lead to a joint attack where two stuck together blocks
            will fall while clearing three lines will lead to a long block falling. By creating a tetris (clearing four
            lines) stacked lines will rise from the bottom of the playfield. Some attacks come from clearing multiple
            lines that are apart from each other. This includes a missile attack that destroys block and a K.O. attack
            that knocks out the opponent preventing him from controlling the blocks for a short while. There is also a
            four player mode where two cabinets are connected. On the Dreamcast version the multiplayer mode can be
            played online.

        <plot>A life simulation which shows how organisms evolve. Take control of one of life&apos;s earliest lifeforms
            and, depending on what environment and habitat you prefer to use, watch as your organism starts to evolve
            and adapt to its surroundings.&amp;#xA;You control your organism from a third person perspective and you can
            choose what it feeds on and how it kills its prey and, depending on the method you choose, your organism
            will evolve to make killing and eating that kind of prey easier.

        <plot>That day in November when the snow turned to rain. Ryu Hazuki arrives home just in time to see his father
            killed by Lan Di, a man Ryu&apos;s father obviously knew very well. Ryu attempts to stop Lan Di, but is
            effortlessly beaten to within an inch of his life. After recovering from his injuries Ryu sets out to track
            down his father&apos;s murder as well as uncover his family&apos;s secrets and the mystery of the Phoenix
            and Dragon mirrors that Lan Di seeks.&amp;#xA;Much of Shenmue&apos;s gameplay involves talking to Ryu&apos;s
            friends and the various people around town, hoping to find hints or clues that lead to the next step in the
            story. Any details Ryu learns are written down in his notebook for future review. Ryu can buy items from
            stores or try his luck with capsule toy machines, but the vast majority of items you can buy have no purpose
            outside of filling out your inventory screen. Ryu can also visit an arcade and play arcade accurate versions

            Fighting plays like a simplified Virtua Fighter game, although with toned down air juggling. Ryu&apos;s
            training also gives him heightened reflexes, and sometimes during a cutscene the player will have only a
            moment to press a button (displayed onscreen) to get Ryu out of danger. Failing an input prompt is not

            across the globe, thwart their evil plans, and save the world!&amp;#xA;Like most 3D shooters, Soldier of
            Fortune consists mainly of exploring the environments and killing the enemies that try to impede the player&apos;s
            progress. It is one of the first shooters to isolate over 20 different body regions and show/inflict damage
            to those regions. For example, if the player character shoots an enemy in the foot, the enemy will limp. The
            game was also notable for including realistic gore animations resulting from the injuries sustained by the
            enemies.

            include destroying enemy compounds, recovering military hardware and rescuing hostages. They take place in
            five different locales: Antarctica, Korea, Pakistan, Thailand, and Germany. Each country has a specific
            mission that entails promoting the well being of the United States of America - there is no specific
            storyline but rather a collection of missions to complete. Most of them are based on possible future events
            in the 21st century, not based on existing, historical conflicts.&amp;#xA;The success of the mission depends
            on the preparations (determining the equipment), which weapons are chosen and which soldier is picked. Each
            soldier has different abilities and some are better suited for specific missions than others. The six
            classed include infantry, grenadier, machine gunner, sniper, close quarters, and demolition. Each class has
            a different payload and arsenal to his disposal, including items such as medical kits and optical devices
            that are restricted to a specific soldier.&amp;#xA;The game is shown from a first-person perspective, common

            original game, adds new ones, and puts them into completely new modes with a focus on online multiplayer.&amp;#xA;The
            game includes online and offline options. Offline functions as a practice mode for online, and has only two
            modes: Arcade (for a standard race against AI-controlled opponents) and Ghost (for a one-on-one against
            oneself). At the start, car selection is limited and further cars can only be unlocked by playing online.&amp;#xA;The
            meat of the game is in Online mode. After customizing their online persona, players start with $10.000,
            enough to buy a car of the lowest class. Money must be earned by racing, enabling players to buy new cars
            and tune them with new parts. There are three kinds of races: Standard, Trial and Vendetta&amp;#xA;Standard
            races allow various ways of earning money, of which winning is only one: breaking speed limits at certain
            points and setting race records (highest speed, fastest lap time, leading the longest) also increase cash
            flow. Trial races involve wagering: a minimum amount is set by the race creator that all participants must
            pay to take part. The creator also sets between one and four challenges from a pool of 22 possible options.
            These include similar records as in the Standard races, but also challenges to always (or never) break the
            speed limit, bust the limit (but never twice on the same radar), get best times on specific laps, always
            improve times from lap to lap or not take any damage. The wagered money is distributed at the end of the
            race between all participants that completed their challenges, taking into account the difficulty of the
            challenge and the final positions of the racers. Vendetta races are always one-on-one, with the winner
            taking the loser&apos;s car.&amp;#xA;The game includes all the tracks from the first game (7 unique tracks
            in 12 configurations), adds a &quot;Heavy Winter&quot; configuration to the Canada track and adds one new
            track (Montreal) with three configurations, for a total of 16 different tracks, all of which can be raced in
            reverse or mirrored, and with weather and time of day selectable. The number of cars has been doubled from
            the original, adding an additional eleven.

            Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character
            designs.&amp;#xA;Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius&apos;s new
            invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device. Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover
            the sinister motives behind the device&apos;s theft.&amp;#xA;This game features appearances not only by most
            major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the
            Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America.&amp;#xA;Spider-Man&apos;s webs are greatly emphasized.
            He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive
            combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective
            shield. His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out. The
            wall-crawling powers are also prominently features. Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling. This is
            used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the
            heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.&amp;#xA;Combat is based around
            Spider-Man&apos;s ability to jump, kick, punch and web. By combining these with direction and in various
            combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee
            range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things. There are a number of boss-battles as well,
            all of which are puzzle-based.&amp;#xA;Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or
            find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the
            police.&amp;#xA;There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable
            Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.

        <plot>A slight change from the normal excessive number of F1 games out there, Spirit of Speed 1937 was an
            attempt to put you into the driving seat of some of the oldest, and well known, racing cars of the
            early-century. Take control of one of the 1930s cars and race it out around tracks, many of which are no
            longer available for professional competitive racing.&amp;#xA;Whilst being a nice attempt to add some
            sparkle to a tired genre, many aspects of the game feel either wrong or awkward. Yes, the steering wasn&apos;t
            as nice on the old cars, but in simulating this the gameplay has become much harder. And why do all the cars
            shine as if made of polished chrome? A good attempt, but not one that rose to the surface of the day&apos;s

            town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn
            new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called
            Isms).&amp;#xA;Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen
            warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)&amp;#xA;Versus - Two
            human players battle it out.&amp;#xA;Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available,
            against a dummy.&amp;#xA;Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him
            here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training).&amp;#xA;Finally, if you complete
            certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile,

            must use all these skills to make it through all four sections of Pao Pao Park and defeat Pinki.&amp;#xA;There
            is also a challenge mode, with a series of short stages to pass all based around proper use of the

            throw, triple jump and high jump), Aquatics (200m freestyle and 10m platform diving), Kayak K1 Slalom, Super
            Heavyweight Weight Lifting, Skeet Shooting and Three-man track cycling pursuit. All events feature 3D
            graphics with cameras that mimic the ones used in TV broadcasts.&amp;#xA;Gameplay is the usual found in
            games of the genre - button mashing the two power buttons is required in most events to build up
            strength/speed, with an additional third button setting the actions, such as jumping or throwing angle.
            Other events feature alternate control methods, such as Slalom (where it&apos;s possible to press certain
            buttons to dodge the rower between the gates if the Kayak is going to hit one or place the paddle to force
            into a certain direction), Diving (following a &quot;click-along&quot; sequence of keys) and Skeet (the
            direction keys controlling the aim, one button to start and other to shoot).&amp;#xA;Along an arcade and
            8-player action, the Olympic mode gives the player the option to build their athlete from the national open

        <plot>Tech Romancer is a 3D beat-em-up with a difference; the difference being that, rather than controlling one
            of a set of martial artists, you control one of a set of huge robots (or mecha). Ranging from the absurd (A
            huge, spherical mech with a boat and bus for feet, a house for a head, train for one arm and office building
            with wrecking ball for another) to the &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; anime styled mecha (Beam-firing chest
            gem, detatchable rocket-powered fists) to a more westernised idea of a mech (Huge, sluggish, equipped with
            heavy cannon, rockets, missiles and land-mines), you&apos;re bound to find at least one which suits you.&amp;#xA;The
            gameplay takes part in large, 3D arenas, usually dotted with buildings and such, which you&apos;ll no doubt
            be happy to learn are destructable (and often contain powerups).&amp;#xA;The game controls consist of two
            attack buttons, one block and one jump. You have a special bar, which works pretty much the same as any
            other special bar - once it&apos;s full (up to a maximum of 3 times) you can pull off a special move. There&apos;s
            an armour bar, which depletes as you take or block certain hits - if it runs out then you&apos;ll start
            taking hefty damage even when blocking. The life and time-bars are self-explanatory, and there&apos;s also
            the special-weapon inventory, which can hold up to five special weapons at a time (these are picked up from
            the battlefield or stolen off the enemy).&amp;#xA;The main single-player mode is a story mode, which is
            completely different for each character and, for most characters at least, branches many ways, often with
            multiple endings depending on choices made and targets met.&amp;#xA;To put it simply, this is a quirky
            pick-up-and-play fighting game with an extensive single-player mode.

            The 3D backgrounds are basic but shift viewpoint as you advance in levels.&amp;#xA;The Battle mode offers
            two to four player multiplayer. One player starts off flagged, and blocks push up from the bottom as other
            players make lines. Once he makes enough lines himself the flag moves to another player. Difficulty is set
            independently allowing for handicaps.&amp;#xA;Unfortunately, you can&apos;t play the battle mode against the
            computer. There&apos;s also no VMU support for saving high scores, a rather critical omission for this type

            the life bar of a player to deplete, include hitting into object, other cars, or just simply falling behind
            the lead car.

            video tape. By collecting enough video tapes, you unlock levels and skateboards for you to use. There are 6
            levels like this. The second type of level is a competition. You get to make 3 timed runs through a skate
            park, and attempt to get the highest score possible. If you do well enough, you will beat the scores of the
            computer controlled skaters and win a medal. There are 3 levels like this.&amp;#xA;There are nine real life

            their toys. Toy Commander is a game that attempts to capture these adventures in an interactive, three
            dimensional world. The player&apos;s perspective is that of the toy vehicles that inhabit a house. The
            various gameplay areas are all based on rooms in this giant house.&amp;#xA;Gameplay in Toy Commander is
            mission based. In each mission, you control one or more toy vehicles to accomplish certain objectives. The
            objectives in each mission vary widely. In some missions, you must drive an army truck and shoot things, in
            some you fly helicopters to pick up and drop off objects, and in some you must race against computer
            controlled vehicles.&amp;#xA;There is a story line that ties together the missions in single player mode. A
            coalition of old toys has started a rebellion against the new toys in the house. An evil Teddy Bear, the Toy
            Commander, is leading this rebellion. It&apos;s your job to stop him. In each mission, your basic goal is to
            complete the task in as short a time as possible. If you meet a certain time goal, the mission is completed.
            By completing 4 missions, you get to challenge the Boss character in the room. If you successfully destroy
            the boss, he will assist you in the final fight against the Toy Commander.&amp;#xA;In addition to the single

        <plot>In the distant future humanity will develop intelligent weapons called Trigger Hearts. Despite their
            awesome offensive strengths, Trigger Hearts aesthetically closely resemble humans, and overtime even develop
            unique personalities. Of three existing Trigger Hearts one, named Faintear, has mysteriously vanished two
            years ago.&amp;#xA;The story begins as the two remaining Trigger Hearts - Exelica and Crueltear (who took on
            the personality of Exelica&apos;s big sister) are summoned to quell a mysterious rebellion of military
            machines against their human creators.&amp;#xA;Trigger Heart Exelica is an arcade-style top-down shooter and
            is composed of 5 stages of shooting mayhem. Most levels take place in futuristic environments such as sky
            cities and space stations. The player is given a choice of one of the two Trigger Hearts at the beginning of
            the game - Exelica, who emits a wide fan of weak shots, and Crueltear, who fires a narrowly concentrated
            barrage of projectiles. However, the firing pattern of guns matters little during the game, as Trigger Heart&apos;s
            most awesome weapon is common to both models, and is called the Anchor Shot. By using the Anchor Shot
            Trigger Hearts are able to grab, swing, use as a shield, and hurl back any flying enemy vehicle in the game,
            including even the most giant of enemy battle cruisers. When thrown, the enemy cuts a path of destruction
            across the entire screen, causing explosive chain reactions between adjacent ships and occasionally even
            obliterating bosses in one hit. The Anchor Shot is a tricky weapon to use, as it requires the player to
            circle the joystick in order to give enemy ships more inertia while continuing to dodge enemy fire. The
            trajectory of the released enemy is also somewhat difficult to predict. Another innovative feature of
            Trigger Heart Exelica is AI-adjusted boss difficulty level, which will cut more slack to the inexperienced
            player, while attempting to punish the pros.&amp;#xA;In addition to the original Arcade mode the home
            version of the game includes a Story mode, which adds fully voiced cutscenes, additional endings and bosses
            throughout the game, and Arranged Mode, which is just like the arcade mode, but is limited to Normal
            difficulty, no continues, and only two lives, and serves as a challenge to the most experienced players.&amp;#xA;The
            PS2 port includes a new opening movie, story mode and CG sequences. TH44 Faintear is now a player selectable
            fighter and The Triggerheart Backupper C&apos;r_na, originally only a story concept, now appears in the
            game.

            fight her way and defeat all the other characters that seek the star in shooter duels.&amp;#xA;The game
            plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling your avatar and attempting to shoot and
            avoid the incoming enemies. The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area, a la Puyo
            Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of
            several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from
            targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special &quot;boss&quot;
            characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.&amp;#xA;Each player has a lifebar, and as
            with most shooters there are bombs, and collectible power-ups to be found. The game features an arcade mode
            in which you can freely select what character you want to control, as well as a 2-player Vs mode and a story

            Striker offered a mix of arcade and simulation style gameplay and a certification mode, where the player was

            within the league twice. The top two teams from each league proceed to round two, similar to round one yet

            tests. Belgium and Holland were not included in the list of 49 teams split into 9 groups in a pre-defined

            Belgium and Holland are split into four groups of four, playing each group member once. The top two teams
            proceed to a knockout format - Quarters, Semis and Finals. Penalty shootouts settle ties.&amp;#xA;Territories
            Cup - Certified 5/10 unlocks this mode, basically league play around various world locations - completion of

        <plot>Ultimate Fighting Championship is based on the no-holds-barred martial art tournament of the same name.
            What makes the game (and the real-life counterpart) distinct from wrestling, boxing, and other fights is the
            variety of fighting styles in use; it is perfectly possible to end up with a judo master facing a kickboxer.&amp;#xA;The
            actual gameplay is simple enough. You have various basic moves, combos, holds, and so on. The complications
            come in the form of the huge list of moves, featuring many different styles. Hit your opponent until he gets
            knocked out, or force him to tap out early.&amp;#xA;There are multiple game modes included. Among them are a
            survival mode, that has you face a string of enemies with minimal recovery, and career mode, which allows
            you to customize and improve your fighting style as you win fights.

            helicopters. While the gameplay is fairly typical for a vertical shooters, Under Defeat innovates by
            allowing players to tilt their vehicles slightly left and right, changing the angle of their fire.&amp;#xA;The
            game was available in two different editions - a regular version, and a collector&apos;s edition pack that
            included a soundtrack CD. Unlike most Dreamcast games which traditionally shipped in a jewel case, both
            versions of Under Defeat came in a DVD-sized keep case.

        <plot>Unreal Tournament is completely different to Unreal - it&apos;s now mainly based on multiplayer, like
            Quake 3.&amp;#xA;At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully
            won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about 3 or 4
            different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you
            control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team&apos;s
            score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The 3rd mode is called
            capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team&apos;s flag to score a
            point.&amp;#xA;The 4th game mode is probably the most innovative one, it&apos;s called assault. These are
            real missions, like you have to attack an enemy base and destroy something in it. Again, there are two
            teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, like 5 or 10
            minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the
            attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack.&amp;#xA;All these modes are either
            playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give
            your bots. Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.

            here: Tournament, Time Trial, and Single Race. One unique feature, however, is the stunt competition. You
            can compete in a series of events that test various driving skills in timed events. Some example events are
            the long jump and the slalom.&amp;#xA;The selection of cars is quite diverse. You can race vehicles that

        <plot>Wild Metal Country is an action game in which one of five little tanks can be selected to control.
            Tank-like machines have gone wild on the three different planets of the Tehric system and the player&apos;s
            job is to defeat them.&amp;#xA;The battles take place in desolate mountain environments. The big differences
            in altitude play an important role in the game. In the single player mode, complete levels by collecting 8
            colored power cores, which are defended by the machines, and returning them to one of several hovering
            stores. The player has an infinite amount of lives. The weaponry consists of 8 types of missiles and 4 types
            of mines. Help is received from a pair of helicopters that drop ammo and provide healing.&amp;#xA;The two
            tracks of the tank are operated independently. For example, make a quick spin by going forward with one
            track and backwards with the other. Moreover the turret can be turned in any direction. The camera always
            moves with the turret sometimes diverting the view towards the camera. The angle of the turret and the
            distance the rockets travel can be changed. The tank can only be controlled using the keyboard.&amp;#xA;Noteworthy
            aspects of the game are: the physics modelling, the 3D engine and the amount of freedom the player has (no
            time constraints etc.).

        <plot>World Series Baseball 2K1 features the actual players, teams, and stadiums of the 2000 baseball season.
            You can play an exhibition game or a season of 13-162 games, including an All-Star game and play-offs.&amp;#xA;Gameplay
            is the standard behind-the-catcher viewpoint for batting and pitching, switching to different views after
            the ball is hit. The famous limitation of World Series Baseball 2K1 is that you cannot control the fielders
            until after the ball is fielded! For this reason the game was almost universally panned by reviewers upon
            its release. This flaw was fixed in subsequent releases of the World Series Baseball franchise.

            on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17&apos;s
            WORMNET.&amp;#xA;For those who&apos;ve never played Worms, it&apos;s at heart similar to the old game
            Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and
            try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a
            team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to
            dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep.&amp;#xA;Everything is presented in a
            humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or
            despair, depending on how you do.&amp;#xA;Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and
            while an improvement over Worms 2, it&apos;s not a huge change.

            and vehicles in this game are modelled in 3D. The textures are quite highly detailed and this adds more
            depth than standard 2D shooters. Secondly, since your craft is a helicopter, a unique &quot;target and spin&quot;
            feature has been added whereby you can both rotate your craft to better attack an enemy or alternatively to
            lock on a particular point in space and rotate around it while still firing. This is all controlled by the
            player however and is not automatic; to succeed mastering this feature is imperative.&amp;#xA;The usual
            power-ups and bosses are included, along with a selection of helicopters to select from.
