        <plot>Jeremy Hartwood has committed suicide in his Louisiana mansion, Derceto. You take the role of either
            Edward Carnby, a private investigator, or Emily Hartwood, Jeremy&apos;s niece, and investigate the
            suspicious death. The three-floor mansion is reputed to be haunted by its eccentric past owner. Very
            quickly, you realise that it is. Warped rats, zombies and giant worms are among the foes who are after you,
            and you must somehow escape.&amp;#xA;Alone in the Dark is an action-adventure survival horror game. The
            action is displayed from a number of fixed viewpoints. The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the
            player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models.&amp;#xA;To escape the mansion, you&apos;ll
            have to solve a number of puzzles. They usually involve finding an item and using it in a proper place.
            Apart from items necessary for the puzzles, you can also find books and documents that can be read, healing
            items which can be consumed to restore hit points, and weapons.&amp;#xA;Weapons come in handy, since Derceto
            is full of various monsters. Some monsters can be killed with weapons, but others are either impossible to
            kill or require a bit of thinking to take down. Note also that you have limited amounts of ammunition, so
            you have to use firearms carefully.

        <plot>In Alone in the Dark 2, you take the role of detective Edward Carnby, one of the two main characters in
            the original Alone in the Dark. Carnby is now called upon to investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack
            after an old detective college name Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders.
            Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack&apos;s dilapidated mansion of Hell&apos;s Kitchen and rescue the girl,
            only to disappear himself. That&apos;s where Carnby comes in.&amp;#xA;Carnby soon learns that Jack and his
            gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth
            Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to
            regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace&apos;s kidnapping).&amp;#xA;Now Carnby must battle his
            way through Hell&apos;s Kitchen and Jack&apos;s army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to
            break the spell and make them stay dead.&amp;#xA;Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to
            the original Alone in the Dark. Like its predecessor, the game uses hybrid 2D-3D graphics. Completing the
            game requires you to solve a lot of puzzles while fighting zombie pirates along the way. Some enemies can be
            killed with the numerous weapons at your disposal, while others need to be defeated via trickery.&amp;#xA;Apart
            from Edward Carnby, the game also includes a short section (two sections in the CD-ROM version) where you
            play as the little Grace Saunders. Grace obviously cannot fight, and thus the sections featuring her are all
            about fast reflexes and wits to evade and outsmart the enemies.

        <plot>This title is one of many pieces of 3DO software that are in fact, not games at all. This title is a
            documentary piece about life on an aircraft carrier at sea in general, and specifically about the general
            workings of day to day activity on the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson while at sea in the Pacific. Included
            with the basic tour of the vessel, you get general ship statistics such as weight, size, speed, etc...
            Mission briefings and a very poorly executed game of landing the jet fighter on the deck of the ship

        <plot>Based on the Casper film, the game pits you in the role of the friendly ghost trying to make a friend and
            a second chance at life instead of scaring everyone away.&amp;#xA;The plot centers around the &quot;spoiled,
            grasping inheritor of Whipstaff Manor&quot; - Carrigan Crittenden. She&apos;s after the treasure she thinks
            is hidden in the walls. Casper will need the help of Dr James Harvey - therapist to the dead - if he has any
            hope of succeeding in his adventures.&amp;#xA;Casper will also have to deal with his uncles - Stretch,
            Stinkie and Fatso, who just love to scare &quot;Fleshies&quot; and thwart Casper&apos;s efforts. The
            gameplay is 3d - and is mostly puzzle solving, with Casper able to take a variety of forms and manipulating
            objects.

            succeed then you advance to the next track.&amp;#xA;In Tournament Mode you drive the same tracks in a sudden
            death race for dominance. Along the way you can win prize money by placing in the top three. You can then
            use that money to add guns, energy weapons, missiles, hazards, armor and other special enhancements.&amp;#xA;You
            can choose from among six vehicle/driver combinations that are weighted towards fire power, speed or
            balance. Unlimited pit stops are available to repair damage and reload your weapons.

        <plot>The interstellar war is over leaving you, a casualty, as a disembodied brain inside a life support system.
            Your buddies rescue you from the lab so that you can go exploring - scavenging the galaxy for wreckage and
            artifacts left over from the war. In due course you stumble literally into an alien craft. With your own
            craft disabled, and the alien ship on a collision course, you must explore it to find out what has gone
            wrong and to make a course correction. So that sets the scene and the scope of the game, it&apos;s an &apos;explore
            alien ship&apos; adventure game.&amp;#xA;Gameplay consists of a lot of video sequences in which you talk to
            your colleagues, animated exploration sequences, and, static door opening and &apos;how do these alien
            controls work&apos; type puzzles. There is also a maze and a bit of shooting, a timed sequence or two, most
            of the usual culprits. There&apos;s no inventory to speak of because being a brain in a box you have no
            pockets.&amp;#xA;All the action takes place in an in-game window that&apos;s your view of the world. It

        <plot>Deathkeep is a 1st person perspective single-player &quot;shooter&quot; game with a touch of medieval AD&amp;D
            gameplay in a full 3D environment.&amp;#xA;Apparently another hero is stuck in a underground cavern crawling
            with monsters (what else is new?). This time they have to defeat an evil Necromancer located somewhere in
            the lower levels. To get to him they have to fight through 25 dungeons (each 8 floors) filled with horrific
            monsters who never heard of dental care.&amp;#xA;Three different characters can be chosen as the hero:&amp;#xA;1.
            Dwarven male Fighter&amp;#xA;2. Half-Elven male Fighter&amp;#xA;&amp;#xA;3. Elven female Mage&amp;#xA;These
            classes offer different combat capabilities:&amp;#xA;1. The Dwarven Fighter focuses more on melee close
            combat with minimal (axe-throwing) ranged and almost no magical capabilities.&amp;#xA;The Half-elven
            Fighter, or more precisely Ranger, focuses on non-magical ranged combat with his favorite bow. Possesses
            medium melee combat capabilities and some magical capabilities.&amp;#xA;The Elven Mage focuses all her might
            in magical offense and defense. Spells may be found or learned as experience grows. Don&apos;t get too close
            to the enemy since a walking stick doesn&apos;t do much damage to bloodthirsty monsters!&amp;#xA;Gameplay
            consists mostly of adventuring and flattening every living and non-living creature in your way. Destroying
            monsters allows the character to level-up and become more powerful as well as gain new spells. The dungeons
            are filled with traps, streams, caverns, ledges, and every possible obstacle to cause the player to lose
            their way in this maze of mazes.

        <plot>In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are being vacated and
            replaced with automated software. You play as an engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading
            the automating code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must
            rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off. The main game takes place in a first-person
            view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside.
            You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for
            card keys during the down time. A third consideration is the &quot;Virtual Operating System&quot;
            controlling all major base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor
            intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase
            the software&apos;s efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to
            auto-attack with a high degree of success. As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you
            have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct
            the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.

        <plot>Demolition Man is a game based on the 1993 movie by the same name. You play as John Spartan (Sly
            Stallone); thawed out from cryo-prison into a peaceful, Utopian future. Your task is to capture your
            nemesis, the psychopathic Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), who has freed himself from prison and is wreaking
            havoc around town.&amp;#xA;The 3DO version adopts a unique multimedia approach to the concept of a movie
            tie-in. Cutscenes and clips from the film are used when appropriate, but Stallone and actual props from the
            film (such as his uniform) were also brought in to shoot bluescreen clips specifically for the game.
            Stallone is placed inside the CD environments, setting up the coming gameplay sequences, which loosely act
            as an expanded &amp;quot;director&apos;s cut&amp;quot; of events in the film.&amp;#xA;The game follows the
            key points of the movie&apos;s plot across five missions (with a handful of levels each). Levels mimic most
            major sequences from the film, with additional ones inspired by. Four distinct game types show up as you
            progress through the plot:&amp;#xA;Shooting Gallery sequences present a static screen with enemies popping
            up from behind cover. Hidden icons grant additional health or special bullet types. Either the standard
            controller or lightgun peripheral can be used here.&amp;#xA;Hand-to-Hand sequences present a side view of
            you and Phoenix brawling as in a standard fighter. Blocks, sweeps, and high and low attacks are mixed up to
            break through your opponent&apos;s defense and wear out his energy.&amp;#xA;First Person Shooter sequences
            place you in a maze of tunnels with numerous patrolling enemies. You have infinite ammo to quickly dispatch
            them. A tracking device can be displayed to show the general direction of Phoenix. Defeating him ends the
            level.&amp;#xA;The Driving sequence occurs once, and has you chasing Phoenix as he tries to flee in a stolen
            police cruiser. Avoid the other cars and hit power-up lanes to gain an advantage.&amp;#xA;Progress is saved
            with a password system, and victory or defeat both earn you one of a few special messages from Sly.

            installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as &quot;isometric&quot;)
            viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual
            presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches,
            was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.&amp;#xA;Based
            on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to
            give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set:
            fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates
            continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering
            shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the
            ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5
            different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team

        <plot>In the future, mankind has been enslaved in a virtual reality simulation known as Perfect. This simulation
            is controlled by an entity known as Perfect1 and it has to be destroyed in order to shut down the system.
            You are Immercenary Number Five, and it&apos;s your job to do it.&amp;#xA;From a secret lab you log into the
            simulation which sends you to a place in Perfect known as the Garden. Every entity in the game has a certain
            rank that determines its offensive and defensive capabilities. You start at 255, the lowest rank, and must
            rise in ranks to defeat Perfect1, who holds rank number 1. To do so, you destroy higher-ranked Rithms, as
            the other entities in the game are called. To pass beyond certain ranks, unique Rithms high in the Perfect
            hierarchy have to be destroyed.&amp;#xA;Different weapons and power-ups can be collected and spent offensive
            and defensive energy can be recharged at energy spires. In the center of the Garden is a place called
            DOAsys, which functions as a neutral zone and healing center. There you can talk to other Rithms and ask for
            hints about combating special Rithms and where to find special items. These dialogue sequences take the form
            of live action clips of actors in elaborate costumes playing the Rithms.&amp;#xA;When the player logs out of
            the simulation or is violently forced out, he returns to the lab where one may load and save a game and
            access detailed statistics on the trips to Perfect.

            graphic adventure game.&amp;#xA;&quot;Come, Watson, come! The game is afoot!&quot;&amp;#xA;London, 1888.
            Sherlock Holmes, the world&apos;s most famous private investigator, and his faithful companion Dr. Watson,
            are called to the scene of a gruesome crime: a young actress has been murdered in an alley behind her
            theatre. Not surprisingly, Scotland Yard&apos;s Inspector Lestrade is clueless. Was it the work of the
            Ripper? Sherlock Holmes is not so sure -- the circumstantial evidence indicates a much more intricate crime.
            The shrewd detective begins the hunt.&amp;#xA;The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes is a classical crime story
            with two distinguished, sympathetic protagonists. In the role of Sherlock Holmes, you travel through London
            in the search for clues. Interesting locations are gradually added to a city map. Your most important source
            of information are dialogues with suspects, witnesses and other people - and with Dr. Watson, who will
            readily comment on the situation. When talking to persons, you may chose one of several lines that seems
            most appropriate. Watson notes down all conversations in his journal, where you can access them if needed.
            Pleasingly true to the novels, Holmes will solve many puzzles through sharp observations and thorough
            searches of every location (thus discovering clues and deducing connections) as well as clever
            interrogations.&amp;#xA;The handling of the game by means of verbs is simple and accurate. Readers of the

        <plot>Follow the story of an absent-minded young sorceress Lucienne and her gang of misfit monsters, as they try
            to stop the evil mage Death Shadow from destroying the world.&amp;#xA;Lucienne&apos;s Quest is a game in
            classic roleplaying genre, but presented in full 3D graphics (and sprite characters) uncommon for the time.
            The battles are fought in traditional turn-based manner, but allow for more strategy than most classic RPGs.
            The game places ambient obstacles on the battlefield to block some attack paths, but allows the player to
            strategically reposition his fighters along the bottom two rows of the map before every turn to take
            advantage of the terrain.&amp;#xA;The game also features a dynamic day/night system which serves little
            purpose other than changing one of your party members from human into a werewolf and back.

            the former for their president&apos;s death. To gain revenge, they secretly inject CyberTech&apos;s

        <plot>While the soccer tournament is often downplayed not only inside the Olympic movement, but also by the
            soccer-following community, in 1996, by the occasion of the Games of the XXVI Olympiad in Atlanta, US Gold
            decided to release a game representing the tournament.&amp;#xA;The player can choose one of the 33 teams,
            and participate on exhibition matches, arcade (a 32-team cup knockout), Olympic (the 16 team tournament
            mimicking the actual tournament) or play on an all-versus-all league (from 3 to 16 teams). The games
            features the usual options found in contemporary games, such as match length and draw rules, as well as
            define several weather patterns from wind to the bumpiness of the grass. All 5 stadiums used in the actual
            Olympics are present.

        <plot>You play Lester, a young physics professor, who suddenly finds himself in a strange alien world after a
            lightning struck during his particle experiment. Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands,
            then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens, who
            together with him escapes from the prison, helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the
            obstacles.&amp;#xA;Out of This World is an action adventure game, where the adventuring element is concealed
            behind what looks like a typical platform shooter. The gameplay is based mainly on physical and
            environmental puzzles. There is no on-screen interface, and no in-game dialogue. Each enemy requires a
            different strategy, and often there is only one way to solve the problem. Typically, enemies will be
            defeated through the use of a gun you find near the beginning of the game; the gun can be used to create a
            shield from behind which you can safely fire.&amp;#xA;The game is divided into levels, each one of which can
            be accessed by typing a code you learn after having completed the level. If you die (which is often) you
            restart the level anew. The game features vector graphics and animated cut scenes.

        <plot>The time for resurrecting historical events has come. Panzer General was one of the first games (if not
            the first) that actually gave you the ability to play for the Nazis, and yet succeed where Hitler failed.
            Having total and complete control over land, sea and air units, you must defeat the Allied dogs as fast as
            you can (to get a major victory), or slower than in history (to get the minor victory).&amp;#xA;The game&apos;s
            quality lies in the quantity of units. There are basically hundreds of Axis and Allied units from World War
            II, accompanied with &quot;circled&quot; animations and battle sounds, as well as marching or moving sounds.
            The Main menu is always located on the right side of the screen, with plenty of options and selections you
            can change to suit your preferences.&amp;#xA;A turn-based hexagon strategy game that will actually go faster
            if you have faster computer, but will always be playable (speed doesn&apos;t go up infinite). The first and
            original Panzer General, this installment would be followed by sequels and many other games in the series
            using the &quot;General&quot; name.

            UFO-shaped puck around the three different tables. The tables are named Surf Room, Luv Room, and Disaster
            Room and they are connected to each other via Nexus. Player can choose to play one room or in the MetaGame
            mode, all of them in sequence. Each room has an objective and in the MetaGame mode, player must reach that
            objective to advance into the next room via the Nexus.&amp;#xA;Like any pinball, there are targets, tunnels,
            blocks, and all sorts of flashing things that increase the score, light up letters, or grant bonus items. In
            addition to inertial control of the puck, player can apply thrust, which is limited, and activate magnetos,
            which are scattered around the room.

        <plot>PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega&apos;s 16-bit console, and technologically the
            most advanced one. Instead of offering several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass
            and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the
            console allow).&amp;#xA;The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were
            digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round,
            etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.&amp;#xA;Gameplaywise,
            PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a
            final one for accuracy. It&apos;s possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin
            and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty
            level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the
            accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However,
            only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards
            from the total capacity of the club.

            original, you are competing against thirteen other &quot;Road Rashers&quot; who will stop at nothing to win
            1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best
            to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you
            trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place.&amp;#xA;There
            are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of
            these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there
            are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and
            you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many
            times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are
            riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times -
            but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash
            cup.&amp;#xA;There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and
            Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to
            pick bikes from a different bike class.&amp;#xA;If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can
            choose the game&apos;s Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money
            involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if
            you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick,
            you will always start in the last place.&amp;#xA;The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the
            outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including
            Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game&apos;s

        <plot>Another version of the ancient game of Mah-Jong. The player is presented with an arrangement of tiles,
            lined up together and stacked, with either 2 or 4 of each of an array of patterns. These must be removed by
            matching pairs, but only tiles which are visible and have a space to the left or right can be removed.&amp;#xA;This
            release in the Activision&apos;s Shanghai series includes three games along with the Classic Shanghai. In
            The Great Wall, the tiles are stacked vertically, and fall when lower tiles are removed, a lá Tetris. In
            Beijing, gaps are created to slide groups of tiles along. The Golden Tile sees two players attempt to clear
            a set layout at once. The Triple-theme continues with three game modes: Solitaire, 2-player &quot;Pandamonium&quot;,
            and Arcade. Three themed tile sets complete the &quot;Triple Threat&quot;.

            type of minerals and metals it is formed of. Some planets are plagued by natural dangers such as lightning
            storms, earthquakes or lava which can damage or destroy your landing modules. Non-sentient lifeforms can
            also be found and stunned to obtain biological samples. Special installations, objects and ruins can also be
            found on certain planets.&amp;#xA;While in &quot;deep space&quot;, your starship can approach any star you
            come across, and then you can guide your ship around its system and land on its planets and their moons.
            Space is treated as two-dimensional and presented in a top-down view. There is also a starmap available
            which shows the entire galaxy and allows you to set your ship on auto-pilot to any star.&amp;#xA;Throughout
            space are different alien civilizations. These are represented on the starmap by a sphere of influence.
            Within the sphere, the aliens have a controlling presence and their ships will venture freely. Outside the
            sphere, encounters are rarer. Aliens can be dealt with diplomatically, through a series of dialog options,
            or in combat.&amp;#xA;Combat utilizes the same engine as the first Star Control game, where action is
            controlled from a top view and influenced by the gravity of nearby planets. Each alien vessel is controlled
            uniquely and has unique abilities. Combat can also be played as a standalone game (&quot;melee mode&quot;),
            separate from the main storyline.

        <plot>3037. FedNet is now in control of the federation, and at an attempt to gain trust of the population
            following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to
            crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being &quot;convinced&quot; to join them
            in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting
            edge technology.&amp;#xA;A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the
            Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are
            texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls
            the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy
            boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, and must keep moving at all times. Two points of
            view are available: behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE
            flight). By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by
            combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.&amp;#xA;One
            of the defining features of the game is using the laser (basic weapon) to terraform the map. As the game map
            is composed by tiles, some with higher or lower vertexes, can be leveled by simply firing repeatedly at the
            same area. This allows players to strategically avoid heavy defense turrets by simply collapsing a hill, or
            destroy an heavier turret by simply burrowing the ground beneath it.&amp;#xA;The player starts the game with
            three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game over, but as there isn&apos;t a
            profile for each pilot (like in Tie Fighter), the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.

        <plot>Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter (FPS)
            puts the player in the boots of B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes (the first
            distributed complete as shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three
            final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the &quot;Nocturnal
            Missions&quot; pack. However, they do not need to be played in sequence to be enjoyed!&amp;#xA;In the first
            episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with the help of a concealed
            knife and managed to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching
            for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given
            the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant
            prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Führer, Die!) has a
            simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself.
            The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where
            B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It&apos;s followed by Trail of the Madman, where the
            goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J.
            meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.&amp;#xA;Each episode has nine levels (eight
            regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight
            first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the
            number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator.
            To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it&apos;s possible to move behind the guards&apos; backs and even
            there&apos;s a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire
            power), and depending on the level, activate &quot;push walls&quot; and/or get silver and golden keys to
            open certain doors.&amp;#xA;Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog
            food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife,
            pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the
            pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas)
            or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds
            of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers
            (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in
            white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine
            gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with
            green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).&amp;#xA;Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a
            number of lives and once the player loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has
            to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures
            or completing a level below the &apos;par&apos; time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by
            pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).
