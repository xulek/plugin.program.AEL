        <plot>AirCars takes place in the future after a nuclear holocaust.&amp;#xA;The large organization E.B.N.E.R.S.
            is plotting to take over the world and has developed advanced forcefield and teleportation systems, and
            nuclear powered AirCars. To stop the plot, your group steals plans, builds its own AirCar, and sets out to
            destroy all of the bases, 28 known and countless unknown ones, stationed around the globe.&amp;#xA;You can
            choose to play a single player game, the 2-player game using a JagLink, or up to 8 players using ICD&apos;s
            CatBoxes. On screen and on radar, each player&apos;s AirCar is displayed in a different color to help
            identify the good guys from the bad guys. There are 3 difficulty settings. You will be using the cockpit&apos;s
            instrument panel to fly the AirCar, select weapons and view radar, as well as combating the enemy in the air
            and shooting ground targets.&amp;#xA;Features include true 3D sound, a computer voice (which can be turned
            off if desired), and music during the introduction and level intermissions.

        <plot>The Jaguar version of Alien vs. Predator is completely different from the Arcade and SNES games of the
            same name.&amp;#xA;The Jaguar version takes place entirely on a Colonial Marine Training base. A ship
            infested with Aliens is found floating near the outer-space training facility. Of course, once the Aliens
            get inside the base, they kill off nearly everyone. Meanwhile, the Predators dock their ship on the training
            base as well. They see this as an opportunity to catch an Alien Queen, and bring honor to their clan.&amp;#xA;So
            there are three scenarios in which to play: First, you can play as a Marine. Your job is to find a way to
            self-destruct the base, and make your way to an escape pod before it blows. The second scenario allows you
            to play as an Alien. Here, your job is to find and protect the Queen from the Marines and the Predators.
            Finally, you can play as the Predator. The Predator must simply find and kill the Alien Queen.&amp;#xA;The
            game plays like a first person shooter. The play field consists of the 5 levels of the training base, plus
            areas for the Predator and Alien ships. All the areas of the ship are inter-connected, giving the game a
            huge virtual environment. Depending on the scenario you choose, you will have to choose different strategies
            based on the capabilities of your character. For example, the Marine will have to make use of his weapons
            and his ability to use the ship&apos;s computer terminals. The Aliens, on the other hand, will have to make
            use of their great numbers and ability to cocoon their enemies. And finally the Predator must fight with
            honor, and not over-use his invisibility capability.

            has one rule - if you can&apos;t get the ball, get the man, and decapitate him if possible. Bonus and

        <plot>The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars&apos; moons
            Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a
            gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply
            vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the
            surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.&amp;#xA;id Software&apos;s follow-up to
            their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person shooter: full-on action seen from the
            space marine&apos;s perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any
            order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as
            shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final
            episode which takes place in Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden
            level.&amp;#xA;The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand
            in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be&amp;#xA;pressed
            to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or
            skull keys must be found to pass.&amp;#xA;DOOM&apos;s engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein&apos;s,
            and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts
            appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely
            illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come
            down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein&apos;s orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM can be
            in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels.&amp;#xA;Stylistically, the levels
            begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment,
            complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up
            mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.&amp;#xA;DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with
            most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol.
            Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing
            rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large
            damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must
            be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two
            further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun,
            that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The
            different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so
            collecting the right type for a certain gun is important.&amp;#xA;DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein&apos;s
            arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other
            powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first
            place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level
            on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation
            suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically
            increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups.&amp;#xA;The
            enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and
            sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large
            one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two
            especially powerful creatures.&amp;#xA;DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes:
            Cooperative allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a
            competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect &apos;frag&apos; points for a kill and
            re-spawn in&amp;#xA;a random location after being killed.

        <plot>Your job in this action puzzler is to help prehistoric man to evolve by helping them discover tools, the
            wheel, weapons, or even fire. Each level in the game will have a given task to help in this, and you are
            allotted a number of characters who must accomplish the task. The player can switch from person to person
            while moving the characters around each scrolling puzzle, and teamwork is essential to success.&amp;#xA;Tasks
            can include finding objects (like a spear) on the screen, or trying to reach a specific destination which
            may require the use of objects you have discovered so far. Each level has a time limit, when time runs out
            the level can be restarted.

        <plot>In this isometric football game, 50 national teams are represented to play in two game modes: Exhibition
            and Tournament (a series of seven games on four continents, with a final against the World All-Stars), with
            the ability to set time, difficulty level, see cutscenes after goals and if players are free to kick each
            other around without (many) fouls.&amp;#xA;While the game seems short-featured for 1995 standards, the
            tournament mode includes a twist: depending on how well the player defeats his opponents, he can trade his
            &quot;standard players&quot;, who won&apos;t do anything spectacular (but at least fill up the ranks) for
            star players, who not only look different, are able to cross and backheel the ball but also have a unique
            ability at the disposal of the player:&amp;#xA;1. The Marker: can latch on an opposing player, stopping him
            from running away with the ball;&amp;#xA;2. Goalkeeper 1: more capable of stopping shots than the regular
            goalkeeper;&amp;#xA;3. Barger: this large, muscular player is able to shove everyone in his path;&amp;#xA;4.
            Tricky: capable of jumping (or bunny-hopping, to be more precise) with the ball tucked between his feet,
            avoiding tackles;&amp;#xA;5. The Cheat: while it&apos;s hard to talk about fair play in a game where kicking
            a defenders&apos; leg to gain a corner is (mostly) a legitimate play, this player takes the whole thing into
            the next level, being able to dig fouls out of nowhere, at the expense of the ball (if he&apos;s carrying it
            or the referee waves play on) or just some stains in his shirt (if he&apos;s trying to pull an offensive
            foul), with the odds of 50/50 (25% for penalties);&amp;#xA;6. Passer: capable of feeding forwards with
            laser-precision passes;&amp;#xA;7. Striker 1: capable of unleashing impossibly-sliced shots, scoring from
            virtually any position in the offensive area;&amp;#xA;8. Striker 2: best used from positions directly in
            front of goal, this striker features a shot that is so powerful the ball ignites as it approaches the goal;&amp;#xA;9.
            Goalkeeper 2: features a better chance of stopping special shots from both Strikers;&amp;#xA;In Exhibition
            games teams start with their own setup of start players, from none to a full team. The playing surface also
            affects gameplay - playing in wet grass removes all ball bounce, the opposite occurring with sand, and the
            most dramatic change, a rocky field where the ball can change direction after hitting the ground, turning
            throw-ins into corners, poor attempts on goals and vice-versa.

            attack by throwing his fists, or winding up his fists for a more powerful punch. He can occasionally find
            special power ups that grant him unlimited flying power, giving him the ability to navigate through tricky

            their ship, but before they are able to leave the Sheriff of Lamini pleads for help. It seems that one of
            the island&apos;s highest ranking council members, the wizard Lord Daggan, has completely lost his senses.
            All sorts of strange and unusual things have been happening. He has been ranting and raving, blowing things
            up, and digging up the corpses of dead mystics. Daggan has remained locked up inside his castle and no one
            sent to confront him has been heard from since. So naturally you accept the quest.&amp;#xA;Begin by
            selecting a character from the four available: Merton, the wizard; Tasler, the boy; Andros, the circus
            performer; or Gerand, the fighter. Then roll until you get the statistics you like for Strength,
            Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity and Constitution. Each of the characters has his own specialty.&amp;#xA;The
            entire game takes place within Daggan&apos;s tower. There are 11 floors, which you can move between freely
            via stairs, teleporters, and the occasional levitation through a hole in the floor. There are no shops for
            buying and selling, so you must use what you find in the castle. As you progress through the levels, various
            mini-quests present themselves (charging an artifact, forging a sword, for instance). Most puzzles have been
            designed so they can be solved two different ways. Music plays throughout the game and the sounds of doors
            opening and closing, your footsteps, monster footsteps, etc. can be heard.

            all your money.&amp;#xA;Opt for a single game or the Slam City tournament, while game options determine time
            limits, scoring system, and control schemes. There are fifteen teams to choose from, and up to four players
            can get in on the action (with the Jaguar Team Tap adapter included with the game).

        <plot>id software&apos;s adaptation of their classic first-person shooter Wolfenstein 3D to consoles is not a
            straight port, but a remix with substantial changes as well as new additions.&amp;#xA;While the basic
            gameplay of exploring levels, shooting enemies, collecting treasures, keys and power-ups remain the same,
            only half of the original game&apos;s 60 levels have been retained. Each of those 30 levels (grouped into
            six missions, with two levels being secret ones) is a simplified version of an original level. The end
            bosses for the missions are taken from both Wolf3D as well as its sequel, Spear of Destiny.&amp;#xA;Other
            changes from the original include new power-ups: an ammo box (taken from Spear of Destiny) and backpack that
            increases the maximum amount of ammo that can be carried.&amp;#xA;The original&apos;s weapons (knife,
            pistol, machine gun, chaingun) all return, but there are also two completely new tools of destruction: a
            flame thrower and a rocket launcher.

        <plot>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on
            a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a
            worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.&amp;#xA;Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can
            control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time
            limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends
            immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single
            attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.&amp;#xA;There&apos;s
            a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings
            and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as
            ropes and girders.&amp;#xA;There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land
            and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be
            formed.

        <plot>Zero 5 was one of the last Telegames releases for the Jaguar, right before Worms. It is a wild
            space-shooter, placing you in control of a small and manuverable fighter craft, or a powerful warship,
            depending upon which level you play.&amp;#xA;Taking on the role of a pilot, you must defend the earth from
            alien attack with dozens of missions needed to succeed. Your tour of duty includes travelling through deep
            space to meet enemy convoys head on and shooting across asteroid and planet surfaces taking out
            installations.&amp;#xA;There are 3 different play modes:&amp;#xA;1. HIT-PAK Mode - Somewhat like a variation
            on the Missle Command 3D VR mode. You are in a turret with four guns to blast everything in sight, including
            asteroids in several levels. No powerups make it more difficult.&amp;#xA;2. BAMBAM Mode - Consists of
            piloting around in the fighter, shooting every object that moves, in 360 degrees. Includes power-ups for
            weapons, shields, and score.&amp;#xA;3. TRENCH Mode - Star Wars style shooting in your BAMBAM fighter, you
            run along a trench. Also includes power-ups.

        <plot>The sequel to Zool sees him take on the bad guys Mental Block and Krool across 15 levels.&amp;#xA;Zool 2
            is a platform game where you control the titular &quot;Ninja of the Nth Dimension&quot; (or his girlfriend,
            Zooz, who can complete each level in a slightly different way) as he rampages through a variety of levels,
            collecting countless tasty treats, shooting any enemies that he encounters and finding bonuses (there&apos;s
            a variety of special power-ups Zool can find - for example, a bomb that follows him and can be blown up at
            any time to remove on-screen enemies, or a temporary invulnerability). New to the sequel is Zool&apos;s
            ability to scale walls and his new spinning attacks.&amp;#xA;On each level you have to collect a certain
            amount of the featured fruit within an allocated time limit, and then find the exit across the
            multi-directionally-scrolling levels. There are lots of hidden areas to see, including a bonus Breakout game
            starring Zool&apos;s pet 2-headed dog.
