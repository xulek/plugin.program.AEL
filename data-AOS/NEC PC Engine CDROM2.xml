        <plot>The story of Advanced V.G. follows a similar template as those of the previous Variable Geo games: the
            strongest young women in the country hold a tournament, which is sponsored by various restaurant chains,
            which in turn ask the competing girls to pose as waitresses working in said restaurants, for promotional
            purposes. The girls of the Jahana group who starred in the previous games return, with the new main
            protagonist being the young martial artist Yuka Takeuchi, who has been training in a secluded forest area
            before joining the competition.&amp;#xA;Like its predecessors, Advanced V.G. is a fighting game, with the
            basic &quot;kick&quot; and &quot;punch&quot; moves, while the various special attacks are executed by
            pressing combinations of buttons. There are three modes in the game, &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Vs., and
            &quot;Story&quot;. The normal mode is basically training matches between the player character and an
            AI-controlled girl. Vs. mode allows two-player mode, as well as demo &quot;computer vs. computer&quot;
            gameplay, with the possibility to choose any of the stages. Any of the eight heroines is available as a
            playable character in these modes. The story mode, on the other hand, allows the player to control Yuka
            Takeuchi only, and follow her story. Cut scenes advance the story between matches.

        <plot>The Cho Aniki series returns with their first sequel, the one that would cement the series humorous fetish

            is a side-scrolling shooter in which you have to clear several stages of enemies with your flying avatar.
            Said avatar this time can be either of the two &quot;option&quot; bodybuilders that were supporting
            characters in the original while the original&apos;s main cast plays only small cameo roles as they appear
            every now and then to drop power-ups.&amp;#xA;Our two beloved speedo-wearing beefcakes also incorporate
            different play mechanics, as their attacks are often determined by button combinations (as in fighting
            games) which put a spin on the gameplay. Otherwise, the game&apos;s graphics and design are practically
            identical to the first game.

            special weapons, by pressing combinations of buttons. Girls might have unique weapons and techniques which

            organizations eventually seized control of the planet, establishing itself as a tyrannic government and

            is a vertically-scrolling shooter, in which the player navigates a plane through levels populated by hostile
            planes, tanks, cannons, ships, stationary devices, and massive boss enemies. Before each mission, the player
            can choose among different weapons in three categories: main, sub, and special. Main and sub weapons are
            fired simultaneously and have unlimited ammunition, while the powerful special attacks are accessed by
            pressing a different button and are limited. The player can try any combination of the three categories, for
            example enhancing the main rocket launcher with a pod that fires laser to the sides as a sub weapon, and a
            protective shield as a special one. Power-ups change properties rapidly, so the player has to catch them at
            a specific time to enhance either main, sub, or special weapon. Those power-ups do not change the properties
            of a weapon, but rather give it additional fire power.

        <plot>The game is based on the comedy TV show Yoshimoto no Shinkigeki, which in its turn is based on a
            theatrical comedy show popular in Osaka and its surroundings. The game stars characters that either look
            like the actors from the TV show and/or resemble characters played by them.&amp;#xA;The show consists of
            short episodes which are depictions of comical situations, and are not related to each other story-wise.
            Same can be applied to the game: there is no real story, just a stretch of hilarious and intentionally
            impossible situation the protagonists find themselves in.&amp;#xA;The setting is deliberately nonsensical,
            with the locations ranging from typical Japanese suburbs to ancient Japan, town in the American Old West,
            North Pole, etc. Scenarios are full of anachronisms: for example, one of the protagonists is sent in a space
            rocket to outer space from a desert near an Old West town, bumps into a planet, and falls back without
            taking any damage.&amp;#xA;Core gameplay is that of a platformer, more precisely an old-fashioned,
            Mario-type &quot;jump-and-run&quot;. Under normal circumstances, the protagonists have no weapons; the
            enemies are temporarily paralyzed (not killed) by jumping over their heads.&amp;#xA;The game contains a
            wealth of mini-games, most of which must be completed in order to proceed. The mini-games include:
            synchronized dancing (through QTEs), rock-paper-scissors variant with pizza throwing, cowboy-like

            the actions of the hero in order to safely traverse a stage full of traps and hazards. Unlike Lemmings,
            there is only one primate to control in this game; also, the player&apos;s &quot;programming&quot; must be
            performed before letting the monkey loose, unlike the real-time player input in Lemmings.&amp;#xA;The player
            basically orders the monkey what to do at specific spots (which are highlighted by exclamation marks on the
            level map). In the beginning the levels are short and simple, and the monkey can perform only one action. As
            the game advances, the puzzles become more and more complex, and so is the amount of actions the monkey must
            perform to reach safety.&amp;#xA;The actions include, but are not limited to: running, jumping (in both
            directions), rolling, pushing, sitting, etc. New actions are learned as the player advances. The player must
            study the level carefully and often predict the behavior of hostile characters as well as laws of physics,
            since the monkey can get easily trapped, killed by enemies, fall off cliffs, etc. For example, a wild boar
            will immediately charge at the monkey; using the momentum, the player can use the animal as a trampoline to
            jump to higher ground.&amp;#xA;Many levels can be solved in different ways. Alternate solutions are harder
            to figure out, but may lead to bananas, coins, and other things of interest.

            of up to five players, and a timed challenge mode. In the latter, the player has to complete specific

        <plot>This platform-based adventure was converted from a Capcom arcade game, and set in the land of Alurea. The
            idyllic life of the Alurean people was shattered when the King is killed by a dragon, and a range of nasties
            inhabit the lands. Fortunately his twin sons have come to the rescue, and you must take control of one or
            the other to put the world right.&amp;#xA;The boys have differing skills - one is more skilled in
            sword-fighting (which you are always armed with), the other in magic (available in limited amounts on each
            level). You collect coins as the game goes on, and spend these in the shop on extra magic, extra lives and
            enhanced swords.&amp;#xA;There are 3 levels on offer - Earth, The Heavens and The Sea, and these can be
            tackled in any order. The first is straight platform action, the second involves jumping across clouds, and
            the third sees your characters swim. After those are completed, you must venture into the Monster Castle and
            finally slay the dragon.

        <plot>Macross 2036 is a horizontally scrolling shooter set in the universe of the Macross anime series. The
            player takes control of one of the series&apos; minor characters, the female pilot Mylene Jenius, who
            navigates the space fighter Veritech, fighting against ships and robotic soldiers of the alien Zentradi
            race. The player-controlled space ship is equipped with a vulcan gun (which can be upgraded with power-ups)
            and bombs, which are released simultaneously. Another button controls a special weapon, which the player can
            purchase for points (awarded for defeating enemies) between stages. The game&apos;s stand-out feature are
            separate boss battles which usually occur after a &quot;regular&quot; boss battle that concludes a flying
            level. After that battle, the Veritech automatically transforms into a giant mecha called Battroid, and
            fights a boss enemy one-on-one. The mecha fires automatically, and the player only controls its altitude and
            the angle of the shot. Anime-style cutscenes advance the plot between missions.

        <plot>Color Wars is a puzzle game in which up to four players try to win by putting colored balls on poles,
            converting adjacent balls to their color. Each stage consists of a rotatable 3D screen containing a number
            of poles of the same height. Players take turns in placing balls onto these poles. Adjacent balls
            (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) can be &quot;captured&quot; and hence change their color. Points
            are awarded per ball of each color. The round ends when there is no more place on the poles to put balls
            onto, and the player with the most points wins. The story mode begins with an introduction depicting a
            powerful demon that can only be vanquished by traveling to the Color World; a young pilot ventures there and
            must defeat opponents in the Color Wars game at each stage. This mode puts one player against three
            AI-controlled opponents; the free mode also allows four human players to compete against each other.
            Two-player mode can be played by either two human players or one player against computer AI.

            during the race.&amp;#xA;Damage can be sustained by driving over environmental hazards (pits, traps, bombs,

            the bottom, it takes damage), being hit by the many enemies encountered in the game (which include a wide
            variety of wild animals, humans, fantasy creatures, monsters, etc.), or being hit by a competing car. Cars
            have the ability to jump over obstacles or enemy fire, avoiding damage.&amp;#xA;Over the course of the
            races, cars accumulate points depending on their results. These points can be invested in purchasing a

            because of Nobita, Doraemon&apos;s best friend and geek extraordinaire. Something went wrong when Nobita was
            showing his friends a time machine, so they ended up stranded in hostile worlds, and now it&apos;s Doraemon&apos;s

            gun, but later is able to find other weapons, including a homing bowling ball launcher and a stun gun. He
            can also collect various power-ups, such as limited invincibility, high speed, an item that freezes all the
            enemies on the level for a short time, etc. It is possible to switch weapons and power-ups at any time.&amp;#xA;Doraemon
            can enter different rooms and caves scattered through the levels. Some of them lead to mini-games (finding a
            correct way through a maze, memory games, etc.), which, in their turn, lead to significant power-ups, such
            as an extra life. The game has a symmetrical structure: each &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; is divided into four
            levels, the last one leading to the boss battle, after which Doraemon travels to another world.

            has replaced real life for so many humans in this grim futuristic scenario of the end of the 21st century.

            reality&quot; levels with abstract design (along with real-world locations), etc. However, the control
            scheme is a bit different. Instead of choosing a main weapon and a sub-weapon in the beginning of a mission,
            the player has four types of weapons and is able to switch between them at any time. In addition to the
            vulcan cannon and the laser beam, which were present in the first game, the player can also use homing
            missiles and a short-range, yet powerful lightning gun as main weapons here.&amp;#xA;All the weapons can be
            upgraded with power ups, up to three times each. Another type of a power up increases the speed of the ship
            (yes, Syd pilots a spaceship-like aircraft this time, not his trademark flying bike). Secondary weapons must
            be picked up, and include additional missiles, bombs, and protective shields. As before, powerful boss
            enemies must be defeated before proceeding to the next stage. Anime-style cut scenes with voice-overs

        <plot>Feed Sluster is a fiend hunter: a man who takes job that involves elimination of mysterious beings known
            as fiends. One day he is contacted by a woman named Beth, who offers him a more demanding job, which
            involves investigating shady activities between humans and fiends, and getting to the bottom of the entire
            mystery, discovering the origin of the fiends and determine their ultimate fate. Fiend Hunter is a cinematic
            platformer set in an Old West-like environment with supernatural elements. With the exception of the initial
            town and a few other locations, the game is spent in areas that require carefully navigating Feed through a
            series of platform-like structures. Controls and animation resemble those of Prince of Persia. Feed can
            jump, run, perform a running jump, hang on ledges, pull up or drop down, kneel and crawl. He also takes
            falling damage; the primary challenge during platforming sequences consists of preventing him from falling
            down. Enemies only appear at pre-set points; each battle is one-on-one, and it is impossible to escape from
            a fight. Coupled with the enemies&apos; high HP count and varied attack patterns, this essentially turns
            each encounter into a boss battle. Feed fights with a sword and can perform various moves, combining attacks
            with jumping and ducking. He can also gain access to a few magic spells. A little fire fiend named Exy
            accompanies Feed on his journey. Exy can be used as offensive and defensive enhancement in combat, and can
            also be set to light dark areas. Each enemy drops a special orb that can be used to increase Feed&apos;s
            vitality, attack power, or magic, as well as teach Exy more powerful attacks, which gives the game a light
            RPG flavor. Feed can also equip rings and buy or find health-restoring and protective potions.

            16 new Wrestlers. Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games.
            Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it&apos;s possible to connect any of
            them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves

            strongest; Jasmine is the second-strongest and the second-slowest. The ships are also distinguished by their
            weapon properties. Each ship can collect red, green, or blue power-ups; collecting a power-up of the same
            color enhances the currently equipped weapon, while a differently-colored power-up changes weapon properties
            while retaining whatever enhancements the ship might have had with the previous weapon. The actual
            properties of each weapon is different for each ship, and include various combinations of lasers, beams,
            missiles, piercing and homing weapons. Each ship also has two pods on the sides that fire simultaneously. If

            electricity during the next shot. In additions, the ships can also drop bombs that heavily damage all the

            up to nine times from the same spot if the protagonist runs out of lives, and additional continues are

            of the enemies are different types of aircraft, though a few stationary turrets appear as well. The
            player-controlled fighter can pick up power-ups that change his primary weapon: red for a vulcan gun, yellow
            for energy bolts, and blue for laser. Each of these will increase in power (e.g. three lasers instead of one
            for the blue weapon) when the player repeatedly collects power-ups of the same color. Other power-ups add a
            secondary weapon or enhancement to any of the described above, such as homing missiles, fireballs, a
            wingman, etc. Secondary weapons are fired simultaneously with the main ones. In addition, special weapons
            can be collected and accumulated. These weapons are triggered by pressing a separate button, and include
            delayed bombs, exploding bullets, protective shields, and others.

        <plot>A scientist named Arnold Steiner researches the ancient civilization of Indios in Central America.
            However, following a breakthrough discovery, Steiner mysteriously disappears. His daughter Chris travels to
            Central America in search of her father, and steps into an intimidating world of monsters and conspiracies.
            Hihō Densetsu: Chris no Bōken is a platformer. Chris is armed with a dagger and cannot use any other weapons
            or gadgets to protect herself. However, the dagger can be upgraded by collecting colored orbs dropped by
            enemies. Depending on their combination, the dagger can be used as a long-ranged weapon, firing projectiles
            or acting as a boomerang. The protagonist&apos;s health is measured with hearts; a stage must be restarted
            if Chris runs out of all five of them. Enemies would sometimes leave hearts and coins behind; the latter add
            an extra life to Chris if she collects a sufficient amount. A boss enemy awaits at the end of every second
            stage. Other features include moving and disappearing platforms, deadly traps such as spikes, mine
            cart-riding, and a strict time limit for each stage. The story is advanced through anime-style cutscenes
            between stages.

        <plot>Originating on the arcades (where it was known as Demon&apos;s World to the Western audience), Horror
            Story is an &quot;old-style&quot; side-scrolling platformer/shooter. The basic gameplay premise is very
            simple: shoot and jump your way through large amounts of monsters, defeat the boss, proceed to the next
            level. There is no narrative of any kind in the game, and no cut scenes; the hero is a tough-looking Duke
            Nukem-look-alike equipped with guns.&amp;#xA;The screen is scrolling at all times, even if the player
            character doesn&apos;t move. The levels are almost entirely linear, the only choice sometimes being to stay
            on the ground or jump to the higher platforms. Cooperative two-player mode is available.&amp;#xA;Though
            shooting is decidedly the main gameplay element here, jumping (particularly double-jumping) must be used
            liberally to navigate the hero through platform-based stages, and avoid and kill enemies (since jumping on
            their heads eliminates them as well). Weapons can be switched by catching power-ups, which appear as
            floating, constantly changing letters. Depending on the letter the player decides to take, the hero will get
            different weapons. These weapons include: a steady energy beam of moderate power; flamethrower; bombs; a
            short-distance grenade launcher of sorts; and a gun that spits fireballs in three different directions.&amp;#xA;As
            the name implies, the game has a horror theme. The game begins in what looks like old Japan, complete with
            traditional Japanese demons, but later switches to more &quot;mainstream&quot; horror, complete with haunted
            towns, ghosts, zombies, skeletons, etc.

            type and direction of weapon (laser, spreading, etc.) at any time, in Before Christ mode, it is possible

            friendly championships rather than in deadly wars. Hyper Wars is primarily a managerial simulation; robot
            combat itself is calculated depending on how the player created and maintained his or her robots. The player
            controls a manager of a team which competes in a league, complete with schedules, stadiums, etc. The player
            is given an initial budget with which he or she is able to create the first robot models and train them.
            Each robot can be created by merging together various parts (&quot;human&quot;, &quot;beast&quot;, &quot;bird&quot;,
            and so on). After creation, it is necessary to outfit the robot with weapons and upgrade its parameters by
            paying for training. When the player feels ready, the robots can be taken to combat arenas and participate

            to defeat enemies; he can also jump and attack in mid-air. Sometimes it is necessary to jump over bottomless
            pits or other obstacles to advance. Pressing down the attack button will charge a special meter that will
            allow Gaō to throw knives at enemies. In addition, Gaō possesses special powerful all-screen attacks that
            come in limited quantities. Enemies may drop charges for such attacks, health-restoring items, and other
            power-ups. Stages usually culminate with boss battles, after which the hero gains access to new weapons and

            or attach a head weapon with different properties (lasers, missiles, etc.) to the ship. Some of the stages

            beginning. The five weapons include spreading energy blasts, focused multiple shot, laser beams that travel
            in different directions, an energy ball that protects the ship from frontal assaults, and an extended arm
            that hits enemies melee-style. The player can cycle through and choose any of these weapons at any time.
            Instead of the traditional secondary weapon system the game offers charged modes for all the weapons. When a
            weapon is charged it either becomes more powerful or gains new properties (for example, the extended arm
            becomes longer and is controlled from a distance). The player character&apos;s health is represented by
            shield units, which can also be picked up in the stages. Dialogue and cutscenes advance the story between
            and within missions.

            weapon, add a secondary one, or grant the protagonist protective shields or bombs that can eliminate all the
            enemies on the screen. Bosses and mini-bosses are present in most of the levels.

            each player selects several fighters to represent in a series of one-on-one battles. The fighting scheme

        <plot>The plot of Metamor Jupiter is simple: a biological mutation causes an alien race to spread all over the
            galaxy. Armed with advanced technology, the aliens sent their machines and robots to face humanity in a
            cosmic battle. To counter that, the humans draw from the newly discovered crystal energy to deploy a unit of
            powerful fighter crafts, which can change their shapes in an instant, adapting to every situation. The
            player controls one of such crafts, and has to fly and shoot his way through side-scrolling levels populated
            by regular enemies, bosses, and various types of hazards. Other fighters will accompany the
            player-controlled machine from time to time, but they usually don&apos;t survive the robotic onslaught, and
            the player character is left to fend for himself. As the premise implies, the defining feature of the game
            is the fighter craft&apos;s ability to change shapes. The three main variations have two weapons each, which
            are suited for different situations. For example, one of the forms has vertical fire, but lacks powerful
            explosives; another can drop bombs, but has a slow forward beam attack, etc. Each of the forms can gather
            power-ups, which will strengthen the conventional weapons. Unlike most shooters of this kind, there are no
            &quot;lives&quot;; instead, the player-controlled plane has a set amount of hit points, parts of which are
            depleted when it gets hit. Hit points can be restored by catching power-ups scattered across the levels.

        <plot>Minesweeper is a minesweeping game, just like the one included in every copy of Microsoft Windows since
            ancient times. On a grid, the player clicks in a cell and hopes that it is not occupied with a mine. If it
            isn&apos;t, that cell is filled with a number, which indicates how many mines there are in adjacent cells.
            Using logical thinking, looking at the relations between different number cells, the player can conclude
            which cells contain a mine and mark them as such. Once all cells are revealed, the player progresses to the
            next minefield. Three main game modes are available, differentiated by the size of the minefield: 9x7, 12x12
            and 18x14. Clearing a minefield takes the player to another one of the same size, but with more bombs to
            clear. A second mode is a mission mode (&quot;voyage mode&quot; in the PC Engine version), where the player
            is presented with 10 minefields each in 7 locations around the world. The first ones are very small, only
            4x4, growing larger and larger from then on. What is different about the mission mode is that a few cells in
            the minefield are revealed from the start, putting the player&apos;s ability of deduction at test. The
            editor mode allows players to construct a minefield of their own, by inputting parameters of size and amount
            of bombs. The Game Boy version can also be played by two players via a link cable. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx
            CD) version contains an additional mode entitled &quot;Cook&apos;s Quest&quot;, in which the player has to
            help a cook to escape from falling boulders in a cave, represented by mines on a familiar minesweeper field.

            to a nearly complete destruction of the Earth. The continents sunk into the oceans, and only a few islands
            remained. Conan is a boy who grew up on one of those islands, a descendant of one of the survivors of a

            island with centralized administration. Conan travels to Industria and is determined to rescue Lana,
            uncovering a much greater conspiracy in the process. The game plays like a fairly traditional platformer
            taking place in predominantly maze-like environments connected by exit areas. Conan can jump, duck, and
            fight enemies with his fists. He can also use a limited numbers of ranged weapons such as spears.

            (resembling racing tracks), City (urban locations), Nature (field, beach, desert, etc.), Märchen (colorful
            fairy tale-like courses), and Special (unorthodox designs, e.g. a giant ape overlooking a road). Courses
            usually include various hazards that slow down or trap cars, as well as turbo fields that speed them up.

        <plot>In the year 2012 an alien armada attacked the Earth. Two young pilots were in the midst of a battle, and
            one of them, a lovely young woman, was killed. Three years later, the surviving pilot finally got a chance
            to avenge her death. Navigating a powerful new fighter ship named &quot;Slasher&quot;, the pilot ventured
            into space, ready to bring destruction to those who took so much away from him. Nexzr is a vertically
            scrolling shoot-em-up similar to Super Star Soldier. The player-controlled spaceship starts with a simple
            vulcan gun that can only shoot straight. Various power-ups can either enhance the strength of this gun,
            replace it with a laser weapon, or add a secondary weapon (homing fire, thin spreading laser attacks, etc.),
            which is activated automatically. Mid- and end-level bosses are encountered on nearly every stage.
            Additional lives can be collected, but the player always restarts from the beginning of the stage when his
            fighter craft is destroyed.

            have attacked a lovely floating island, defeated its guardian, and stole the crystals that protected it. Two
            young magicians, Anis and Lester, decide to put an end to monster invasion. Players can choose to control
            either of them in single-player mode, or join forces in co-op gameplay. Like in Bubble Bobble, the goal is
            to eliminate all the enemies on screen by turning them into bubbles; this is achieved by shooting
            projectiles at them from a magic wand. These bubbles can be destroyed with the wand or thrown at each other
            for a more effective result. Each monster, however, turns into a bubble of a particular color, and making
            two bubbles of the same color touch each other releases the trapped monsters. If it takes the player too
            long to kill all the enemies, tougher ones will appear on screen. The game consists of six worlds, each
            comprising nine regular and one boss stage.

            head of a famous criminal - only to realize that his body escaped without the head. Mail tried at least to
            sell the head in the nearest town, but discovered that the local tavern was full of these heads stored in a
            basket. But not all is lost: Mail reads a poster that promises a big reward for someone who catches an evil
            wizard who terrorizes the land. Sounds like just the job Mail was looking for! This version of Popful Mail
            is quite different from later releases, even though it has the same story and basic gameplay. However, the
            layout of locations, regular enemies, bosses, concrete events - everything is entirely different. This
            version is less of a fast-paced platformer and is more focused on exploration, with more maze-like levels
            and back-tracking. As in the other versions, there are &quot;friendly&quot; areas where Mail can buy
            weapons, armor, and items. There is no &quot;attack button&quot;: Mail attacks by simply running into
            enemies or jumping on them.

        <plot>A year after the release of the falling block puzzle game Puyo Puyo for MSX and Famicom, an arcade version
            was released that took the basic concept, but transformed it from a solo into a competitive game, changing
            the series fundamentally: all ports and later entries in the series are based on this version. The original
            arcade version has two modes: a single-player story mode and a two-player competitive mode. In story mode
            (which is based on characters from Compile&apos;s RPG series Madō Monogatari), the player controls Arle
            Nadja (Silvana in the English translation of the arcade version), a young sorceress, whose goal is to defeat
            Satan. To do so, she has to win 12 battles against his minions until she can meet him in a final
            confrontation. The game offers an extra training mode against three lesser opponents, as well as the ability
            to start from level 4 of the main game. During a match, pairs of puyos fall down from the top of the screen
            into each player&apos;s field. They can be moved left or right, rotated in either direction and made to drop
            faster. The goal is to arrange puyos of the same color into patterns of at least four, with horizontal or
            vertical (but no diagonal) connections. Doing so removes them from the field (with any unconnected puyos
            falling down) while at the same time sending garbage blocks into the opponent&apos;s field. Creating
            patterns of more than four, several different patterns at the same time, or chain reactions creates more
            garbage blocks. The garbage blocks can only be removed by creating patterns adjacent to them. The player
            whose playing field reaches the top first loses. In single-player mode, the falling speed of the puyos
            increases level by level and each of the enemies plays in a unique style. The home ports also add an endless
            single-player mode, in which there is no opponent (and thus no garbage blocks) and one simply plays for a
            high score, similar to the MSX/Famicom version. Unique to the Game Gear version is an additional quest mode.
            Similar to the mission mode of the original MSX/Famicom version, it presents a series of pre-filled playing
            fields with a specific task, like making a minimum number of puyos disappear in one move, or removing all
            puyos of a certain color. Progress is saved via passwords.

        <plot>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot &apos;em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.
            You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire. The R-9
            comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing
            several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of
            energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in
            your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called
            &quot;The Force&quot;, which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship,
            absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use
            it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in
            R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and
            in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger
            main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends
            laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow
            one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements). The stages of R-Type are made in
            an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger&apos;s artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out,
            it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot&apos;em&apos;ups.
            In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like
            creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems.
            Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation
            that is required of R-Type&apos;s contemporary rival, Gradius.

            fighting game. Unlike the earlier Ranma 1/2 iteration by the same company, this game does not follow the

            However, the game is still rich on story-telling; fully voiced anime-style cut scenes appear after each

            skills. As Ranma, the player can revert to his female form (this time at will, simply by pressing a button);

            mechanics, with punches, kicks, jumps, combinations of buttons to execute specific moves, and powerful

            natural form by touching hot water; however, contact with cold water will turn him into a girl again. Most
            of the original manga story is dedicated to semi-comical situations, based on the fact that Ranma is trying
            to conceal his predicament, which leads to misunderstandings, confusion, and romantic complications in his
            high school life. This interpretation of the license follows a part of the initial manga story, starting
            with the curse and going through Ranma&apos;s first conflicts with schoolmates and rival martial artists.
            The game is mostly structured like a &quot;beat-&apos;em-up&quot; side-scroller, though there are also
            several boss fights that are more reminiscent of a one-on-one fighting game. The Vs. mode allows the player
            to recreate these boss fights using different characters. Ranma&apos;s curse becomes a gameplay feature in
            the game: cold and hot water turn Ranma into a girl and a boy, respectively. Female Ranma is quicker and can
            jump higher, but her attack and defense are lower. Anime-style cut scenes advance the story between the
            levels.

            car is to the completion. Should the car run out of time, the race is lost, and the player has to replay it
            before tackling the next one. The car can be controlled with two buttons only; collisions do not damage the
            car, but merely make it stop; though the player can change a car model and gear system, no realistic
            gear-based driving is used in the game. All this contribute to the overall arcade feeling of the races.

            Visually and audibly, it was a league above Irem&apos;s and Konami&apos;s offerings. When Taito (and others)
            ported the game to home machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield to fit in one single screen, and
            re-dubbed it Darius Plus. The plot of Darius involves the two heroes Proco Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the
            menaces posed by galactic fish and other sea animals again their homeworld. What sets Darius apart from
            other shoot&apos;em-ups of the time is its way of letting the player choose his path with a certain amount
            of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two worlds which the area
            branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach the end of the game
            by. Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and
            little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which is nowhere

            Power-ups can be collected for each type of attack. In addition, a devastating special attack can be stored
            (for one charge) and executed.

        <plot>Tecmo World Cup Super Soccer is quite different from the similarly-named Tecmo World Cup Soccer. In this
            football (soccer) game players can choose between competing for the World Cup or participating in the
            Japanese league tournament. Only eight international teams (Brazil, Argentine, Japan, England, France,
            Spain, Italy, and Germany) are available. Before a match begins players can choose between three general
            strategies for the team - normal, offensive, or defensive. Weather conditions (normal, rain, or snow) and
            match length can be selected as well. The game itself is played from a third-person perspective that
            slightly switches between isometric and top-down depending on the situation.

        <plot>Originating in the arcades, Dynasty Wars is a beat-em-up set during the Three Kingdoms Era of the Chinese
            history, and is, more specifically, based on the Tenchi o Kurau manga adaptation of the story. The player
            adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his
            opponents, mostly infantry and archers. Four historical characters from the time period can be controlled:
            Zhang Fei (fights with a halberd), Liu Bei (broadsword), Guan Yu (a Chinese pole weapon known as guan dao),
            and Zhao Yun (pike); some of the character names are misspelled in translated versions. The characters are
            distinguished by their health and strength parameters. The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can
            move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack
            will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the
            player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In addition, so-called &quot;tactics&quot;
            can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the protagonist&apos;s HP in
            process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes. Stages typically
            culminate in boss battles. Along the way, various power-ups can be collected. Besides treasure that
            increases the player&apos;s score, and food packs that heal the protagonist, there are also yellow and blue
            orbs, which represent the game&apos;s light RPG elements: yellow orbs count as experience points and
            increase the character&apos;s vitality after a stage is over, and blue orbs increase the power of his
            weapon.

        <plot>Eple is a young girl donning a penguin costume, who lives in a secluded village in a snowy region of
            Northern Japan with other humans and birds. One day, following a monster attack on the village, Eple and her
            penguin friend fell into the water and drifted to faraway lands. The duo must face fearsome enemies and
            dangers to find a way back home. Travel Eple is a top-down action game similar in concept to Bomberman. The
            game is divided into stages, each consisting of one screen. Every stage has an opponent who tries to kill
            Eple either by attacking directly (most regular enemies only have close-range attacks, but bosses may not
            follow this rule), or by throwing objects at her. Eple, on the other hand, has no attacks on her own and
            must rely on these objects (mostly explosives such as bombs and grenades) to hurt the enemy. Objects keep
            appearing randomly in various parts of the screen as long as the battle continues. Stages may contain
            hazardous areas that damage Eple, or other spots that prevent her from walking around normally.
            Health-restoring pots also pop up from time to time. A few stages require Eple to access a magic staff,
            which grants her various protective abilities (e.g. an ice force field that absorbs fire damage). A versus
            mode is available, in which players compete against each other by controlling Eple and her friend Pal. Their
            magical abilities can be customized before the battle begins.

        <plot>The TV Show is a humorous overhead action game similar to Bomberman in concept. The game consists of a
            scenario mode (single-player) and a versus mode (up to four players). Both modes offer seven characters to
            choose from. The characters are comically-themed and include a hyperactive schoolgirl, an armored ninja, and
            others. There is no real storyline behind these characters; each comes with a short introduction sequence
            that invariably leads to their admittance to an alien-organized TV show, where they have to defeat enemies
            and retrieve prizes. Each stage is an overhead screen containing the protagonist, enemies, the prize, and
            several bombs. The bombs should be picked up and carried around; they are used to deal with enemies and blow
            up the receptacle in which the prize is contained. The green bombs change their color to yellow and red when
            picked up, at which point they are about to explode and have to be thrown to avoid damage. Bombs also blow
            holes in the terrain, and the player must pay attention not to fall through. In addition to bomb-carrying
            and bomb-throwing, each character possesses a special ability. These range from throwing projectiles at
            enemies to speeding up when driving a bike, depending on the selected character.

            Vecanti, and install himself as the Dream Land&apos;s new ruler. Cham, the leader of the resistance against
            Galgear, hears the voice of Yuko, the former Valis soldier who has now become a goddess, telling her that
            one of the resistance members, a girl named Lena, is the heir to the Valis sword. Lena and her sister Amu
            decide to rescue Valna and find a way to stop Galgear. Like its predecessors, Valis IV is an action
            platformer. It is similar to the previous game in allowing the player to control three different characters:
            Lena, Amu, and Asfal. Each of the characters wields a unique weapon (Valis sword for Lena, boomerang for
            Amu, and lance trident for Asfal) and has access to their own elemental spells (thunder for Lena, fire for
            Amu, ice for Asfal). Each one also has a special ability: Lena can slide through narrow passages, Amu can
            double-jump, and Asfal is immune to certain traps. Along with recovery and spell-enhancing (up to three
            levels) items, characters can also acquire special spheres that increase the overall count of their hit- and
            magic points.

            He is aided by the treacherous Necromancer, who turned the soldiers of Farland into monsters. Will Latok be
            able to defeat the evil once again? Xak III: The Eternal Recurrence is an action RPG, similar in gameplay
            style to its predecessors, but also incorporating some elements first introduced in Tower of Gazel, such as
            the ability to jump and having companions (although this feature is much more limited here). Jumping ability
            is crucial in many cases, as there are obstacles that can only be avoided by jumping over them. Latok starts
            at level 50, but still can gain experience points and become stronger. A new (and very useful) feature is
            hit points restoration, which occurs when Latok is standing still. To counter that, enemies can re-spawn,
            which means that there aren&apos;t many completely safe areas in the game.

        <plot>The Dawn of Ys is one of two games released under the title of Ys IV, the other being Tonkin House&apos;s
            Ys IV: Mask of the Sun. The two games share the same basic story, but have many differences regarding
            concrete events, locations, gameplay details, etc. The events of the game take place a short while after
            those described in Ys II, and before the events of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys. As the game begins, Adol and
            his friend return to the town of Minea, where the first game began. The evil Lord Darm has been defeated,
            and it&apos;s time to relax and spend some time with friends - but not for long. A new evil is rising, and
            Adol decides to set sail for the overseas land of Celceta to investigate these occurrences. Ys IV returns to
            the style of play used in the first and second games. The gameplay area is viewed from a top-down
            perspective, and the player attacks enemies by running into them to cause damage. Combat is slightly more
            sophisticated than in the first two games, since Adol can now move in eight directions, and attacking
            enemies diagonally or from the sides is more efficient than bumping into them headstrong. Adol gains
            experience from defeating enemies, which serves to raise his attack and defense power, like in the previous
            games. He can equip various swords, armor, shields, and rings to enhance his attributes. The magic system
            introduced in Ys II is also brought back for this game.

            as an &quot;underworld detective&quot; and solving demon-related mysteries. This adaptation of the manga
            follows the &quot;Dark Tournament&quot; story arc, where members of Yusuke&apos;s team confront the powerful
            demon Toguro. Despite its premise, which is reminiscent of a versus fighting game, Ankoku Bujutsukai is an
            arcade-style shooter. The player selects one of the five characters (Yusuke, Hiei, Kurama, Kuwabara or
            Genkai), and is then taken to a series of one-on-one shoot-outs in a pre-determined order. The enemy is
            viewed from a first-person perspective, and the player moves a cursor to aim and shoot. The gameplay system
            is fairly simple, allowing the player to execute three types of attacks: regular shots, charged shots, and
            special attacks of limited quantity. Points are received for winning fights and can be used to raise the
            characters&apos; hit points, speed, or number of special moves.
