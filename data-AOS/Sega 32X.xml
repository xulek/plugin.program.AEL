        <plot>Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat
            and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons
            (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the
            time.&amp;#xA;The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters.
            But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and
            shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your
            missiles.

        <plot>The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars&apos; moons
            Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a
            gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply
            vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the
            surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.&amp;#xA;id Software&apos;s follow-up to
            their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person shooter: full-on action seen from the
            space marine&apos;s perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any
            order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as
            shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final
            episode which takes place in Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden
            level.&amp;#xA;The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand
            in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be&amp;#xA;pressed
            to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or
            skull keys must be found to pass.&amp;#xA;DOOM&apos;s engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein&apos;s,
            and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts
            appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely
            illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come
            down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein&apos;s orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM can be
            in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels.&amp;#xA;Stylistically, the levels
            begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment,
            complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up
            mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.&amp;#xA;DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with
            most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol.
            Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing
            rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large
            damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must
            be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two
            further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun,
            that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The
            different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so
            collecting the right type for a certain gun is important.&amp;#xA;DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein&apos;s
            arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other
            powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first
            place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level
            on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation
            suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically
            increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups.&amp;#xA;The
            enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and
            sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large
            one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two
            especially powerful creatures.&amp;#xA;DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes:
            Cooperative allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a
            competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect &apos;frag&apos; points for a kill and

            and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on
            eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.&amp;#xA;Up to four human players
            can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This
            allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third
            player with a CPU team-mate.&amp;#xA;The Tournament Edition ups each team&apos;s roster to three players,
            and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player&apos;s
            stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and
            cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options
            menu:&amp;#xA;1. &amp;quot;Hot Spots&amp;quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points
            (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.&amp;#xA;Powerup icons appear
            randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &amp;quot;on-fire,&amp;quot;
            enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players
            to the ground.&amp;#xA;&amp;quot;Juice Mode&amp;quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x.&amp;#xA;&amp;quot;Tournament
            Mode&amp;quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all
            the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also
            unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.
