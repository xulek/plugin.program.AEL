            need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by
            which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of

        <plot>You are at the carnival, and are going to take a chance at the shooting gallery! Your goal is to earn as
            many points as possible by shooting the various targets before you run out of bullets. In addition to the
            assorted targets that float by, there are boxes which can be shot to earn additional bullets. You also need
            to be careful of the ducks! From time to time, a duck will fly down and eat some of your bullets if you don&apos;t
            shoot it first. You move on to the next round of gameplay when the rack has been cleared of all the targets,
            and the game ends when you use up all of your bullets.

        <plot>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the
            forest&apos;s insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves.&amp;#xA;The
            player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the
            controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player
            is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic
            wands.&amp;#xA;Insect Opponents and Mushrooms&amp;#xA;All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before
            attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are
            as the following:&amp;#xA;1. The Centipede&amp;#xA;The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave,
            the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a
            head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede
            with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into
            heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads,
            independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.&amp;#xA;Attacks
            from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the
            Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it
            will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear
            from the top of the screen again.&amp;#xA;The Spider&amp;#xA;The Spider will attempt to distract the player
            from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it
            is hit in closer distances.&amp;#xA;The Flea&amp;#xA;The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most
            of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will
            disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.&amp;#xA;The Scorpion&amp;#xA;The
            Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing
            so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.&amp;#xA;Mushrooms&amp;#xA;Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest
            and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to
            complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic
            mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an
            insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom.
            Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any
            mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom

            leader is kept hostage. The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights
            you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter
            numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the
            joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches,
            and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path
            you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is
            correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you&apos;ll have to back track a bit and
            try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you
            reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your
            quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights
            will also cause you to lose even more time.

            throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race.&amp;#xA;The flat running events involve simple

            appropriate moment.&amp;#xA;For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on
            your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points
            at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.

            and Donkey Kong.&amp;#xA;Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different
            industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets
            from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs
            out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.
            From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.&amp;#xA;Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant
            stream of barrels, &quot;living&quot; fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other
            future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited
            amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline&apos;s hat, purse and umbrella for additional
            bonus points.&amp;#xA;Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video
            game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in
            versions of the game for early 1980&apos;s consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with
            the cement factory usually omitted.

            higher bonus points can be scored.&amp;#xA;Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two
            chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or
            falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.&amp;#xA;In the final cut

        <plot>Evolution is an arcade style action game with six levels where you need to evolve from an amoeba to a
            human. Each level is a different stage in evolution with it&apos;s own unique goals. The first level is the
            amoeba stage where you need to eat all the DNA on the screen while avoiding the spores, microbes, and
            antibodies that are trying to stop you. The second level is the tadpole stage. The tadpole needs to eat
            three flies to move on to the next stage while avoiding the very hungry fish. Next is the rodent stage,
            where you need to eat five blocks of cheese while avoiding the snakes. In level four you need to guide a
            beaver across alligator infested waters to retrieve sticks and build a dam. The fifth level is the gorilla
            stage, where your gorilla has to use coconuts to fight off monkeys that are trying to steel its orange
            stash. And finally is the human stage, where you have to use a laser gun to fight off mutants that are
            trying to take over the earth.

            are extinguished. The game progresses in this way, alternating between the upwards-shooting levels and the
            sideways-shooting levels. On the higher difficulty levels, cats turn up at intervals in the windows, falling
            down after a while. Freddy must catch the cats, or he will lose a life. Similarly, he loses a life if hit by

            them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous
            creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your
            mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly
            around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range
            microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you&apos;ll
            encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls.
            You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful
            you don&apos;t blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to
            destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine
            shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls
            and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.

            being regular lines of wall in the maze, there are also several rotating doors that can be used to trap
            enemies and escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game. In the center of each
            maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out enemy creatures. An new enemy creature is spawned
            every time the border around the screen makes a complete &quot;lap&quot;. Timers for the border vary upon
            the level, so later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression through the game brings
            smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies.&amp;#xA;In addition to the collection of X&apos;s, each
            maze also contains a variety of powerups that come in three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is
            deadly both to the player and the enemy. If the player is able to lure and enemy creature into a poison
            powerup, it will die and be removed from gameplay. Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions:
            Collected at the right time they will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses.
            However collected during the the improper time will only earn the player a few points. For most of the
            gameplay the colour of all powerups (except skulls which are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds
            it will cycle through yellow and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to
            that colour&apos;s word. The red word is &quot;SPECIAL&quot; and the yellow word is &quot;EXTRA&quot;.
            Spelling the word, EXTRA gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word, SPECIAL brings the player to
            a special bonus round.&amp;#xA;Hearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the
            X&apos;s being picked up, first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are lost when the player
            dies, but letter powerups are not.

            you will need to figure out how to get there! You can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you
            will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on
            the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, or a canon!) Wandering around the mine are numerous
            radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bobs way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various
            artifacts left behind; if Bounty Bob collects one of these, the creatures will temporarily become
            vulnerable. If Bounty Bob runs into one of the creatures in this state the creature will be destroyed, but
            if he runs into a creature while it is glowing Bounty Bob will be destroyed! There is a total of ten
            different levels, and to complete them all you will need quick reflexes as well as figure out a unique

            in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward

            where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.

            (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you&apos;ll
            need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the
            race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the
            race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty
            and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a
            track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.

            love! She is at the top of the screen dropping tokens of her love, and you need to collect them before they
            hit the ground. After you have collected the required number of items, you can move on to the next, more
            difficult level. There are many obstacles trying to stop you from completing your task, though! Brutus
            wanders around the screen and is constantly trying to catch you. If you collect a can of spinach, you can
            temporarily knock him out, otherwise Brutus will knock you out. Other objects such as bottles or birds are
            also flying around the screen and will cause you to lose one of your lives if you are hit. Each level
            features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will have you collecting different items as they

        <plot>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to
            the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change
            color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may
            need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert
            are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and
            falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the
            snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.

            dimensions. Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make
            sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of
            blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of
            his jump. Unlike the original game, you don&apos;t need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but
            rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next
            round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!)
            that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where
            the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a
            creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are
            added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the
            sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don&apos;t jump off the edge! To help out, a
            green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.

            your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden
            objects, you carry a geiger counter with you; the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of

            climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other
            platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but
            will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond
            power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing
            treasures of some kind which are worth extra points.&amp;#xA;Your player also cannot take a fall, except for
            extremely small ones unless he is able to climb down vines. This means that when you shoot your rope and are
            climbing it, you are vulnerable. Even more so because enemies are allowed to &quot;shake&quot; the rope
            until you fall off if they reach the base of the rope. Pterodactyls fly overhead and drop eggs on the

            demon-mutants! They are multiplying quickly! And when their numbers grow to sufficient strength, they will
            pour out of all the caves on the surface, spreading poison and death! Your task — slurp up these viperous
            devils while avoiding their vicious attacks. And BEWARE —the CAVE PHANTOM is ever lurking — invisible —
            ready to strike!

        <plot>So! A creature for my amusement! Prepare for Battle! These are the words uttered by the alien commander
            upon starting a game of Space Fury. The gameplay is similiar to Asteroids in that you have one screen of
            space that wraps back on itself and your ship can only thrust and fire. However, whereas in Asteroids you
            faced pieces of rock that couldn&apos;t give chase, Space Fury instead provides alien vessels that will hunt
            you down. Each alien vessel starts in 4 pieces at diagonal corners which will try to join together. Shooting
            any of these pieces before is possible and will make things easier for your player. When one or more pieces
            reaches the center point, it combines with other pieces there and begins to fire upon and give chase to your
            vessel. There&apos;s only one screen of space, so your tactics are limited. However your vessel is not
            completely basic. Provided from the beginning are three superstructures, of which you can choose one, that
            provide additional firepower to your ship.

        <plot>Threshold is a simple Shoot&apos;em up game. You are in control of a spaceship at the bottom of the screen
            and have to shoot several formations of enemies on the top of the screen.&amp;#xA;To make things more
            difficult you have limited time in form of a fuel tank which will get refilled after you cleared a number of
            waves. Besides that your spacecraft is equipped with a laser that tends to overheat. Every shot make the
            heat bar of the laser increase a bit. Once it reached its maximum you can&apos;t fire anymore and are forced
            to wait until it cooled down while slowly running out of fuel.

        <plot>Time Pilot is an arcade style shooter. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you need to destroy the squadrons
            of enemy craft that are attacking! On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed.
            After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the
            next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In
            1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology.
            Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even
            flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus
            points.

        <plot>Most of the conventions that became standard for tennis simulations appear in this early title - indeed
            many were pioneered by it. Matches can be played at quarter-final, semi-final or final level - winning at
            one level automatically moves you onto the next one. They can last for 3 or 5 sets, with a player requiring
            a 2-game lead to win a set, although a tie-break comes in at 6-6 in all but the final set.&amp;#xA;The view
            is pseudo-3D, from above the court, and features a shadow on the ball to give a more realistic appearance
            and make it easier to judge its height. Spectators turn their heads to view the action, and ball-boys run on
            to the court to retrieve a dead ball. Shot speed, direction and spin can all be applied, and forehand and
            backhand strokes are both available.

        <plot>Greetings, Professor Falken. Shall we play a game?&amp;#xA;This strategic game is based on the popular
            1983 movie of the same name, starring Matthew Broderick. It might remind people of Missile Command but the
            action is slower and spread over six screens which represent different areas of the U.S.A. Enemy missiles,
            planes, and subs will attack and you must direct your own forces, which include missiles, planes, subs, and
            satellites, to intercept them. Each type of defense has strengths and weaknesses (missiles are fast but
            limited in range, planes are slower but have unlimited range). Satellites are a better all-around defense
            but are only available every so often. Some weapons aren&apos;t available in certain areas, and some enemies
            are resistant to certain weapons, so you must alter your strategy accordingly.&amp;#xA;As your bases and
            cities are struck, a DefCon indicator for each area will count down and when the overall DefCon reaches 1
            for a minute or when all cities and bases are destroyed, a counterstrike is launched and the game is over.
            The game is won by preventing a counterstrike long enough for a cease-fire to be reached. There&apos;s eight
            different difficulty levels to progress through as you get the hang of it. A two-player mode on the
            Colecovision lets one player to use the Roller Controller to guide and fire weapons, while the second player
            inputs keypad commands.

            available, usually you will need to destroy one of the many enemies so they turn into a crystal. Fire and
            water crystals can not be in the cave alone at the same time, an air crystal must be placed between them; so
            you will need to bring back the crystals in the order fire, air, water or water, air, fire. Once you&apos;ve
            done this a super crystal is formed unlocking the secret passage so you can try to get the diamond! Your
            dragon has a limited amount of energy; being hit by enemies will cause the energy to deplete, and the game
