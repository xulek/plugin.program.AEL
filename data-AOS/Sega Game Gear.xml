        <plot>Aa Harimanada is a sumo wrestling game based on the manga and anime created by Kei Sadayasu. As in the
            real sport, the goal is to knock the opponent out of the ring. However, it is not a particularly realistic
            interpretation of sumo, playing much like a traditional 1-vs-1 fighting game. There are grabs, throws, and
            special moves, and the player can also win by knockout by draining the opponent&apos;s stamina. There is a
            single-player mode that follows the story of protagonist Harimanada, as well as a versus mode for one or two
            players where any of 15 characters can be used.

            level as the remaining modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master

            team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other
            team and beat him to the top spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races
            are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects
            or other cars frequently.&amp;#xA;3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without

            pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a
            pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is
            a bonus item, the &quot;BB coin&quot;, which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from
            the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent&apos;s playfield all at once, increasing the
            difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she&apos;ll win when her opponents get

            must move through five stages on his way to defeat the Penguin. These include the streets and rooftops of

            standing in Batman&apos;s way can be defeated by throwing the Batarang at them, which will take out most
            baddies with one or just a few hits, even though the weapon&apos;s range is limited. Other tools Batman can
            use are a grappling hook to pull himself up to higher levels or swing across dangerous areas, and his cape,
            which can be used as a parachute, for more control during falls.&amp;#xA;Unlike in the Master System
            version, Batman can take more than one hit: he has a health bar, which can be refilled with powerups hidden

            floor. The main goal of each stage is just to get from left to right. However, at one point in the game, you
            reach a ticket counter, and you cannot proceed if you do not have enough money to buy the concert tickets.
            So apart from reaching the exit, each stage must be searched for money, which both lies around and is
            contained in lockers, dustbins, coin-operated telephones and other things. Sometimes, even primitive puzzles
            must solved, e.g. by picking up books and selling them in the book shop. The stages are filled with all
            kinds of life decreasing obstacles, mostly bombs, moving objects or vermin. Beavis and Butt-Head have no
            means of attacking or defending, so everything must be evaded. The player controls only Butt-Head, Beavis is
            just following and will do any action delayed. However, if any one of the two is hit, you loose energy
            (which can be restored by picking up food). Possible actions are running, jumping, ducking, picking up items
            and interacting with the object in the background (if possible).

            thing he finds is a huge wall. When trying to sneak through a hole, he is transported to a strange, hostile

            the main character. His only way of defense is the hammer which is used to punch holes in the platforms:
            when monsters walk over them, they get stuck. When using the hammer on those trapped monsters, the platform
            is filled up again, the monster falls down and is killed. There are two added benefits: a falling monsters
            is deadly to other monsters and it leaves a power-up behind, e.g. an extension of the time limit or a
            stronger hammer.. Sometimes the player encounters boss monsters which require a bigger hole. While some
            levels are based on the arcade version, others are different. This version also adds a shop where the player

            and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow
            bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must
            be popped by jumping into them, wherein they&apos;ll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float
            by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the
            player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon
            Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.

            save his girlfriend Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel, Mickey Mouse must venture into the Castle of
            Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must collect

            way is to pick up objects lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and
            throwing them at the enemies. Mickey&apos;s ability to pick up things and carry them around also leads to

            otherwise out of reach. In some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object
            is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets access to its contents, which

        <plot>Clutch Hitter is a typical baseball game based on the arcade version of the same name. It has all the
            Major League teams and their stats for the 1991 season. However, it does not have players names or team
            names. The game&apos;s look is similar to R.B.I. Baseball and it is based off on Sports Talk Baseball for
            the Genesis. You can also link to another Game Gear and play against a friend. The length of the innings can
            be determined to choose from five, to seven, to the full nine innings and when batting the screen splits up
            to see both first and third base to keep an eye on the baserunners.

        <plot>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear
            them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged
            into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for
            double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up &apos;combos&apos;
            - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.&amp;#xA;As well as the normal game
            mode, there is also a &apos;flash&apos; mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from
            the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number
            of complete rows which are already in place.

            Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with

            with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for
            up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: &quot;battle&quot; (attack),
            &quot;retreat&quot;, &quot;spell&quot; and &quot;monster&quot;. While the first three commands are quite

            can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good
            attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master.&amp;#xA;In-between

            level designs and also several differences in gameplay. Players control Daffy Duck, who is hired to
            reacquire Yosemite Sam&apos;s Golden Cartoon Movie Awards, stolen by the nefarious Doctor Duck Brain. Daffy
            has to make his way through six different worlds of three levels each. Each world is based on a movie genre
            including western, horror, adventure, sci-fi and more. At the beginning of the game, the six levels of the
            first two worlds can be selected in any order. Completing all six unlocks the levels of the next two worlds.
            Each level consists of several sections. The entry to the next section only opens once Daffy has dispatched
            a number of enemies in the current section. To to so, Daffy is armed with a bubble gun. Shooting bubbles at
            enemies makes most of them float away, some however are invulnerable and must be avoided. Daffy can upgrade
            his gun via bubble power-ups, making it shoot faster, in different patterns or with more power. Also
            available are magic wand power-ups which summon a &quot;fairy duck mother&quot;, preventing Daffy from
            losing a life by absorbing the next hit - otherwise, each hit is instantly fatal. Golden clipboards give
            continues while dollar signs, gold coins and diamonds can be collected for points. Not every level contains
            one of the Movie Awards, and collecting them isn&apos;t even necessary to finish the game. Yosemite Sam won&apos;t
            be pleased however if not all are recovered.

        <plot>Dragon Crystal is a dungeon crawler with RPG elements, along the lines of classics such as Rogue or
            Nethack. Without relying on a story, the game throws you into a randomly generated world which you should
            explore carefully - and most importantly, where you must survive! The complex, maze-like levels reveal their
            structure only after you cover the corresponding map areas. Your goal in each level is to reach a teleporter
            which will take you to the next one. There are also a lot of random items scattered around - weapons, armor,
            money, and food. Money allows you to continue the game if you die, food prevents you from starving. The
            enemies are visible on screen, and you fight them in a fast-paced turn-based combat, moving around and
            pressing direction arrows to strike with the equipped weapon. You are always accompanied by an egg which
            will eventually grow up to be a dragon if you have leveled up enough.

            and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must

            from a first or third person point of view, with the fighters facing each other directly. The player can
            choose to see the fight from his or from the opponent&apos;s point of view (&quot;through his eyes&quot;).&amp;#xA;Players
            can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the Career mode, using a created boxer
            to work their way up the 15-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character
            creation, players can choose the fighter&apos;s head, color of skin, trunks and hair, physical and mental
            attributes. The physical attributes are dominant hand, power, speed, recovery and stamina. The mental
            attributes are style (brawler, dancer, boxer and dodger), killer instinct (low, medium or high) and favorite
            punches (jabs, straights or hooks aimed at head or torso, one for each hand). Between matches, career mode
            offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.&amp;#xA;The players can choose the view
            mode (normal or reverse), three kinds of control schemes, round length (up to four minutes) and fight length
            (up to 12 rounds).

        <plot>Originally entitled Fantasy Zone Gear: Opa Opa Jr. no Bōken, this game plays very similarly to the arcade
            and console game of the same name. However, its background story is different, and technically, it is a
            sequel to the first game. The player controls Opa Opa Jr., the son of the previous game&apos;s hero, whose
            goal is, among others, to rescue his famous Dad from the clutches of evil aliens. Like other games in
            Fantasy Zone series, the game is an arcade-style shooter for one player. Boss enemies guard the exits of the
            levels and must be defeated in order to advance further. The player can also purchase better weapons and
            engines for the ship at some points.

            installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as &quot;isometric&quot;)
            viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual
            presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches,
            was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.&amp;#xA;Based
            on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to
            give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set:
            fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates
            continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering
            shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the
            ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5
            different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team

            pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level
            get extra commentary phrases.&amp;#xA;The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles.
            The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system&amp;#xA;FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all
            around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the

            Challenging Stages, which are set to music and feature &quot;dancing&quot; enemies. The objective is to
            shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points. There are a total of 29
            stages. The player can begin with one ship with two in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only
            one in reserve). Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes
            multiple shots to destroy. Others explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and
            occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that &quot;wiggle&quot; their way
            down the screen. Some enemies arrive in spherical &quot;eggs&quot; and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when
            hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main
            attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly
            straight down off the bottom of the screen. Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and
            it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield
            to other enemies. Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while
            in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side,
            then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and
            finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. In
            addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders
            and green blobs.

            right punches that can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no
            regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury&apos;s points, provided between the
            rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the
            start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.&amp;#xA;Each match the player&apos;s
            boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It
            sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the
            ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match the player is awarded
            skill points to be distributed over three characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.

            original Aleste pilot Ray Waisen.&amp;#xA;As usual, your task is to exterminate level upon level of nasties
            with your space ship. The usual Aleste powerup systems remains fairly intact. You still have powerup pods
            which release P capsules for upgrading your main weapon. On the other hand, secondary weapon upgrades are no
            longer released from ground bases, but from another type of flying pods. When you start out, your secondary
            weapon is a laser, which can later be replaced with powerups ranging from split fire to napalm rockets and
            target seeking power balls. Both primary and secondary weapons are in constant use, since only button 2 is
            used for firing both weapons at once. Due to the smaller screen estate of the Game Gear, the sprites are
            larger and the playfield more constrained, for which the game compensates somewhat by introducing
            multidirectionally scrolling sections.

        <plot>Head Buster is a so-called &quot;future sports&quot; game about robots. On a top-down, horizontally
            scrolling playfield, armed robots are moved around in a manner similar to Super Robot Taisen strategy games,
            albeit without many of the refinements of that series.&amp;#xA;Each game starts at the shop, where robots on
            your team are bought and equipped according to your tastes and finances. After that, the game begins in the
            robot arena, blue team against red team in one corner each. The goal is not explicitly to destroy the robots
            of the opposing team, but to destroy their base. In order to reach their base, and to prevent them from
            reaching yours, a certain amount of fighting is required. Each turn is split into a movement phase and a
            combat phase, and since actions of both sides are only executed when a phase is over, you cannot know when
            moving how close you will get to your opponents.&amp;#xA;Robots are available in three basic classes, from
            light to heavy, but can be modified with new movement units (different terrain squares have different
            movement properties), better armour and new weapons. Different weapons have both different strength and
            different ranges, as well as a limited supply of bullets. Reloading is done during the combat phase, but
            requires that your robot stays out of combat during that turn. Different sensors and command units can also
            be added, giving the robots better aim or particular abilities such as dodging, shielding and healing.

            character had unique abilities such as observing the whole level and growing to unlimited height, James Pond

            large levels, which often contain steep mountain sides and other tricky areas. Once again, he has to oppose

            style with a more cartoon-like approach. Unlike in the actual TV show, there always only two contestants.
            Players can choose their avatar from six different characters. The game supports one or two players: in a
            two-player game, both share the same Game Gear and must buzz in by using either the d-pad or the face
            buttons. Once buzzed in, the question must be spelled out within 60 seconds, with the game allowing for some
            spelling variations and minor misspellings. Game rules are accurate to the original show and include Daily
            Doubles and the Double Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy rounds. The game features a cartoon representation and
            digitized speech samples of TV host Alex Trebek (plus a digitized picture on boot-up) and a rendition of the

            3 difficulty levels (beginner, normal, and professional) in a full game (5 min per quarter) using all the
            real rules and scoring. The teams are made up of 28 American city names with no team names (or player names)

            player as they try to run up the field. Once the player is downed the game turns to a play selection screen
            where the player can choose their next play (tactic) out of the 17 different preset plays available, as well
            as a punt, attempt at a field goal, or a turnover, all done in full view of the opponent (the CPU will
            change their play to match yours). More often then not Joe himself will give a tip on the best play that it
            will default to. On the field the player controlling the quarterback can throw it to the receiver (changing
            the player control to the receiver), change the receiver to pass to, or try to run with the quarterback.
            When play changes hands and the player becomes a defender the player has 6 defensive plays to choose from as
            well as a turnover. On the field the player controls a single player chosen by cycling though the players or
            selecting the player closest to the selected receiver. Two player mode works the same as single player but

            spirit, called Zenki, appears again, after having been sealed in a column by Enno Ozuno - Zenki was freed by
            Ozuno&apos;s descendant in present day, a school girl called Chiaki Enno. However, Zenki has only the form
            of an ill-mannered child, and Chiaki can only transform him into a useful form by using a magic bracelet.
            Together, Zenki and Chiaki must avert the threat caused by the seeds of Karuma, who started to appear and
            transform people into monsters. The game is a platformer which lets you control either Chiaki or Zenki,
            which both have different abilities. While Chiaki can break stones with her powers to clear the way and look
            for power ups, Zenki has spinning attack. Like in Sega&apos;s Astérix games, you choose at the beginning of
            each level which character to play. Further, the level can be left to pick the other one. For boss fights,
            the game switches to a different mode reminiscent of one-on-one fighting games, where Zenki faces the
            opponent in a more powerful form.

            which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland.
            However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them
            to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces. Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills,
            although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones from the original and is
            perhaps the best option for first-time players. The others range from digging methods such as a scooper
            (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to
            produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a
            Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to
            others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any
            combination of skills and experiment. Unlike the first game, the player is rewarded for saving as many
            Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings
            through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. The
            player can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. Because there are 12 tribes, and the
            player can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to
            progress. The game saves progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.

        <plot>The Game Gear received a unique adaptation of the 1997 dinosaur sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park. It
            is primarily a side-scrolling platform game but also includes some other gameplay elements. Players control
            a hunter who, armed with a stun rifle and having enlisted the the help of a friendly Procompsognathus (&quot;Compy&quot;),
            must make his way through various levels on Isla Sorna to finally reach a helicopter and escape. The next
            level to be played can be chosen on an overview map of the island, allowing for some freedom regarding level
            order. In the standard platform levels, the goal is simply to reach the exit. Various dinosaurs must be
            avoided or taken out with the gun and environmental dangers like sand pits, rock avalanches and water holes
            must also be mastered. The gun&apos;s ammunition is unlimited and the hunter can take several hits before
            losing a life - his health is indicated by the color of his shirt. Replacement body armor is available as a
            power-up. In one of the levels, players don&apos;t control the hunter but Compy instead. Compy can only take
            one hit before losing a life, and instead of a gun, he has a jump attack. He also has the ability to climb
            walls. After most platform levels, a boss fight against an especially large and/or dangerous dinosaur
            follows, each attacking in a certain pattern requiring its own strategy to defeat. Variety from the standard
            platforming comes in a level where a raging Triceratops attacks from the left and the hunter must run for
            his life through the automatically-scrolling landscape. The final escape from the island takes place in a
            car, seen from the front (i.e. driving towards the screen), with a T. Rex attacking from behind. Both the
            dinosaur&apos;s attacks as well as obstacles on the road (like boulders and water puddles) must be avoided
            to reach the goal.

            available for selection and game length can be set from 3 to 9 innings. Before the game, starting pitcher
            and batter line-up can be selected from the team roster. Gameplay itself follows the standard model of the
            time: players control pitching, batting, running and fielding, with pitching/batting seen from a view behind
            the batter and running/fielding seen from an overhead view of the field. The game supports various pitching
            styles, bunts, holding runners on, lead offs and steals. The game also allows for players to create their
            own teams from all available players. Two team slots are available. Teams and season progress are saved to
            battery-backed RAM.

        <plot>If you&apos;re bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the
            Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types
            across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the
            sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.&amp;#xA;These levels were packed with variation. The
            Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had
            you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of
            shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump
            across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.&amp;#xA;Viewed from
            overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through
            the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy -
            ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race
            (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row
            without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.&amp;#xA;The real
            innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets
            far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the
            end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were
            completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores
            are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system
            as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

            ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.&amp;#xA;Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by
            eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms.
            Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer
            power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost&apos;s eyes float back to their center box, and
            regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.&amp;#xA;Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will
            be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms.
            Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of &quot;Junior&quot;.

        <plot>This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast
            and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on
            eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.&amp;#xA;Up to four human players
            can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This
            allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third
            player with a CPU team-mate.&amp;#xA;The Tournament Edition ups each team&apos;s roster to three players,
            and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player&apos;s
            stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and
            cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options
            menu:&amp;#xA;1. &amp;quot;Hot Spots&amp;quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points
            (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.&amp;#xA;Powerup icons appear
            randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &amp;quot;on-fire,&amp;quot;
            enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players
            to the ground.&amp;#xA;&amp;quot;Juice Mode&amp;quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x.&amp;#xA;&amp;quot;Tournament
            Mode&amp;quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all
            the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also
            unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.

            Swimming.&amp;#xA;Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the 80s. 100M
            Sprint, 110M Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a button mashing sequence with just some changes:
            in the hurdles the player must hit the action key to jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of speed)
            and in swimming, the sequence takes over one and an half minutes and the action button touches the edge for
            the return swim. In these events, the player initially faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the
            final if ends in the top half. It&apos;s possible to watch the other semi-final.&amp;#xA;Hammer Throw
            combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the action button to release the hammer,
            while Pole Vault combines an initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up
            and the action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical event where the
            player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being the one with the highest score on all three
            rounds.&amp;#xA;The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
            hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the Soviet Union). Each nation has it&apos;s own
            sample of the anthem and a set of athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will
            perform differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World Records, in others,
            lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The competition is split in two tables: sorted by medals and
            by total score (the gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 13).

            Reason enough for Bruno&apos;s vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by
            aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father&apos;s pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the
            office. Now it&apos;s up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating
            plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly
            normal settings as seen through kids&apos; eyes - and rescue his dad!&amp;#xA;The Ottifants for the SEGA
            Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting
            with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas
            each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno&apos;s primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him
            the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or
            boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the
            stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno&apos;s special skills and can - depending on the
            colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed
            with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more.&amp;#xA;Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and
            collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno&apos;s score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are
            several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are
            quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two
            different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The
            varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire

            block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.&amp;#xA;The objective of the game is to place
            ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many
            ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man&apos;s directions are chosen at random between
            left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against
            a block or a &quot;wall&quot; on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping
            puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter
            on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but
            it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.&amp;#xA;Also, like many
            puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It&apos;s similar to the many versus modes
            of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.&amp;#xA;The
            game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more
            than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change
            Pac-Man&apos;s direction with the press of a button.&amp;#xA;All of the handheld versions (including the one
            on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.

            dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.&amp;#xA;Pac-Man&apos;s
            goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost
            Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch
            from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.&amp;#xA;Pac-Man can turn the tables on his
            pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue,
            and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost&apos;s
            eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.&amp;#xA;Survive a few
            rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.

        <plot>Panzer Dragoon Mini is the Japan-only 8-bit version of Sega&apos;s popular 32-bit rail shooter, but due to
            (massive) hardware limitations, the game has more in common with other classic Sega game, Space Harrier.
            Taking further away from the original games, there is no rider and the game lacks any plotline.&amp;#xA;The
            player starts by choosing one of three dragons, and from there must shoot at incoming enemies (although for
            most time, just avoiding incoming fire is an easier way to progress in the game). At the end of the level
            (each with two bosses), a password appears and allows the game to be resumed later.

            e.g. mirrors which reflect shots; the direction is indicated by small arrows on the floor. Destructible
            blocks are distinguished by their colour, for example a purple block becomes blue when shot once and
            vaporizes after the next. Enemies are also capable of destroying blocks. Reflected own and enemy shots
            (along with mines on the floor) can kill the space ship, but extra lives can be earned by collecting power
            ups. One speciality is that the player can change the position of the gun; either left, right or central.

        <plot>Power Drive is an arcade racing game based around rally driving. Handbrake turns and lurid powerslides are
            both possible, and the steering is suitably loose.&amp;#xA;There are 3 types of stages - individual
            time-trials, head-to-head races against the computer, and some skill tests. There are 8 rounds of gameplay,
            set across countries ranging from Sweden to Kenya. You get prize money for winning races, and it costs money
            to repair damage.

            future, and not the steam-punk 1930s of Powerstrike II for the Master System. As in GG Aleste, you&apos;re
            the woman pilot of a space fighter faced with the task of saving the world by destroying a lot of alien
            spaceships and technological plantlife.&amp;#xA;The gameplay in GG Aleste II has been further refined since
            its predecessor. Before starting out, you&apos;re given the choice between all the secondary weapons, with
            suggestive names such as Hammer Hawk or Rising Masher. These are upgraded in the same vein as in GG Aleste
            until you reach a frightening potential, covering the screen in bullets and napalm explosions. As a last
            resort, you&apos;re also given the ultimate weapon; a smart bomb destroying all enemies on-screen.
            Unfortunately, you&apos;re only given one bomb per life. As far as the weapons arsenal goes, this is the
            pinnacle in 8-bit Aleste versions. The graphics have been revised with a clearer look which turns out better
            on the Game Gear&apos;s fuzzy screen.&amp;#xA;Perhaps taking a cue from the Sonic games of the time, the
            bonus levels are in 3-D, giving you the chance to earn bonus points and extra lives by shooting down as many
            baddies as possible in Galaxy Force style.

            road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.&amp;#xA;By
            winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better
            bike. Whenever you&apos;re knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and
            lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is
            possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.&amp;#xA;Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the
            game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a
            two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.

        <plot>Your name is Kevin Codner - rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a sinking cruise
            liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers
            desperately need your keen oversight and &quot;shipsmarts&quot;. In 60 levels you have to rescue as many
            passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in
            the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order
            to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left,
            reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the
            wrong way, the passengers either can&apos;t use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped
            off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.
            There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course
            the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a
            lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in
            creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to
            provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane. Each
            level has a certain &quot;save limit&quot;, meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of
            passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit,
            represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the
            passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting
            exhausted and drowning, so you&apos;d better be on time with some assistance. At the end of each level you
            receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without
            having to progress through them all from the get-go.

            Mutants are &quot;using&quot; human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants,
            Bart must use his X-ray Specs.&amp;#xA;The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space
            Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them
            red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to
            make him get out of the bar.&amp;#xA;Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the
            game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in
            the game.

            minutes). While there is no NFL license, the included teams are based on the 1995 season and include the two
            expansion teams Carolina and Jacksonville for a total of 30 teams. Gameplay is seen from a
            horizontally-scrolling view from above the field. The playbook allows choosing from over 90 plays. The
            baseball module also includes Exhibition and Season games with a password function. It allows the setting of
            game length from one to nine innings and the toggling of automatic running. 28 MLB-based teams are available
            (but without an official license). Gameplay follows the standard model of the time: pitching and batting are
            seen from a view behind the batter. When a ball is hit, the view zooms out to show the entire field for
            running and catching.

            up to stop a mad scientist from destroying an inhabited planet so that he might reenter the mysterious Nexus
            energy ribbon.&amp;#xA;The game has several different playing modes. The first is starship combat: seen from
            the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space,
            firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you
            navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.&amp;#xA;On away missions, the
            view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at
            enemies.&amp;#xA;Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this
            is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt
            the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right
            place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.&amp;#xA;The
            second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a
            grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don&apos;t
            always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.

        <plot>The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D Tetris. Players drop tiles
            into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles
            simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The
            player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate &quot;address&quot; along the top of the screen. Stacking three
            copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.&amp;#xA;There
            are two game modes building on this basic concept:&amp;#xA;1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where
            the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with
            completed addresses.&amp;#xA;Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player
            connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear
            on your opponent&apos;s side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your
            opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete
            stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.

            where crime is rampant, which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the
            syndicate by themselves.&amp;#xA;Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to
            jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a
            limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two
            grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing
            with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and
            a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but
            weak hitter.&amp;#xA;Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two
            exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage
            with a boss in the end. Some levels feature &quot;death drops&quot; where the player must avoid falling,
            while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level. Several items are
            scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples

        <plot>Super Golf is an overhead golf game with one complete course of 18 holes. The controls follow the
            traditional two-click system: the power of the hit and the swerve are determined after pressing a button
            twice with the correct timing. The used club and the basic direction is set before the hit. Together with
            the used golfer&apos;s talents (putting, power, accuracy and luck) this is used to calculate the result of
            the hit. There are always four athletes competing; either human or AI controlled.

            an island pulled up by the Chaos Emeralds. Suddenly, while relaxing, Tails hears an explosion that seems
            like it&apos;s coming from inside the island. A Flicky tells Tails that Battle Kukku has invaded the island.
            He also tells Tails that Battle Kukku is mining here for the Chaos Emeralds, to obtain it&apos;s power.
            Tails gears up and heads for his quest to find the machine parts to build his weapon to defeat the evil
            Battle Kukku. There are however major plot differences between the Japanese and the western release. In the
            US and European version of the game it tells the story how Sonic and Tails decide to go separate ways for a
            while. Tails finds an unknown island and decides to dub it Tails Island. While resting there, a large
            explosion occurs and a Flicky tells him birds are invading the island.&amp;#xA;Unlike the other games in the
            series, this spin-off is less of a traditional platformer, but has a much slower pace with rpg elements and
            a focus on puzzle-solving. Tails can walk, jump, fly (momentarily), hang on ledges and throw bombs. He
            starts with ten health points that can be replenished with rings, but the amount can be extended to 99 by
            collecting chaos emeralds. In the twelve stages Tails can collect up to 26 items. Per level however, he is
            only allowed to bring along four and this adds a tactical dimension. One of the most vital tools is the
            Remote Robot that can squeeze through small areas that Tails cannot reach. Underwater he changes into the
            small submarine Sea Fox.

        <plot>Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with
            it&apos;s own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty
            shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of
            them must be completed in one sitting.&amp;#xA;The gameplay can be tweaked for the players&apos; preference
            by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight
            (lighter balls travel higher, faster and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy
            balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and
            players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks
            to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building
            up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth
            deflection.&amp;#xA;Graphically, the game is similar to EA&apos;s Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects
            allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field.&amp;#xA;The
            series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker&apos; 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.

            Real-Time. The Normal viewing mode shows the fighters from a more distant position (smaller sprites) than
            the Large mode (larger sprites). The Real-Time mode simulates the zooming camera effects from the other
            Virtua Fighter games, alternating between the Normal and Large modes. It also has an extended intro
            sequence, with anime style cutscenes.&amp;#xA;In regards to gameplay, the game doesn&apos;t differ much from
            any other 2D fighting game, as the player can perform punches (button 1), kicks (button 2) and jumps (up),
            as well as some special maneuvers. The Game Gear version has also a block function (START button), absent in
            the Master System version. The fights are regular best of 3 round matches, and players will loose a round if
            one of this three possibilities happen: their energy is depleted, they fall out of the ring or they have
            less energy than the opponent if the time runs out.

        <plot>The oldest of the four Grand Slam tournaments, held in London on grass every July, is the basis for this
            tennis game. The ball comes off the grass surface fast and low, reflecting the surface&apos;s reputation for
            providing the most exciting tennis. It&apos;s viewed in the typical third person perspective, although with
            quite a distinct 3D effect and with shadows. You can play standard 1 or 2 player matches, or play the full
            tournament from the quarter-final stages onwards. You can play standard shots as well as lobs and drop
            shots, and full service rules are featured. You can select your character and build up their skills as the
            game progresses.

        <plot>Wonder Boy III: The Dragon&apos;s Trap is a direct sequel to Wonder Boy in Monster Land. When Tom-Tom

            your original human form, you have to find the Salamander Cross, hidden by the Vampire Dragon in Monster
            Land.&amp;#xA;In this side-scrolling platform game, you can still buy equipment and items, but unlike its
            predecessor, it is not divided in sequences of levels. You are allowed to go anywhere, as long as you have
            the right shape or equipment. During his quest, Tom-Tom has to defeat various dragon bosses. Each win will
            give you a new shape with new abilities such as flying, swimming, walking on ceilings or clinging to walls,
            which also give you to access new parts of the world. The possible shapes are Lizard-Man, Mouse-Man,
            Piranha-Man, Lion-Man and Hawk-Man and the main abilities are defined by attacking power, defense points and
            charm points (needed for equipment by collecting charm stones). Also, certain blocks can only be destroyed
            by specific weapons or are only accessible to certain shapes.&amp;#xA;The basic actions consist of attacking
            and jumping, and in the status screen you can equip swords, shields and armour. Special attacks include fire
            balls, tornadoes, arrows, boomerangs and thunder strikes. Along the way, you collect keys (only one at all
            times) and gold left behind by defeated creatures, and you often have to revisit places to access new areas.

            the mid-eighties, following the success of Taito&apos;s Arkanoid. Sega&apos;s answer was called Woody Pop.&amp;#xA;With
            a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks laid out in a
            big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit &quot;mystery bricks&quot;,

            bounce back in the corners.&amp;#xA;Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three
            adjacent rooms to progress to, making this game less linear than usual.&amp;#xA;Like any post-Arkanoid game,
            there is a range of powerups released from special blocks. Most are known from other games such as the
            double-ball, the growing bat or the &quot;diamond ball&quot;, which destroys all blocks in its path without
            ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire, allowing them to destroy
            even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits bricks with more power, thereby destroying brick with
            one hit that would otherwise have required several.

            various pitfalls and hazards as well.There are no true power-ups; instead, there are picnic baskets
            scattered throughout the stage, a 100 of which will grant the player an extra life. Likewise, there are
            icons labeled &quot;1-UP&quot; that will give the player a life, as well as health-refilling items. There
            are also hidden doors and areas that the player must find in order to locate the various safes. When Yogi
            enters these safes, he must collect the 25 gold coins to get a bar of gold; collecting 12 of these gold bars
            will give Yogi the money needed to win the game.

        <plot>Yu Yu Hakusho: Horobishi Mono no Gyakushu is based on the the manga / anime series Yu Yu Hakusho, which is
            about the teenage delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, who is appointed as an &quot;Underworld Detective&quot; after
            being killed in a car accident while trying to save a child&apos;s life. His task is to investigate various
            cases involving ghosts and demons in the human world.&amp;#xA;The game is a classic side-scrolling beat&apos;em
            up and offers several characters from the manga to play. Apart from, as expected, Yusuke the player can
            choose between Hiei, Kuwabara and Kurama. All characters have different values in five attributes like
            jumping or speed. The game offers some variations from the standard beta&apos;em up formula: There are four
            different levels accessible from the beginning and can be played through in any order. However, after
            completing level, the player has to choose a new character he hasn&apos;t used yet for the next stage. If a
            character looses all his health, he has to fill it up with the health of the other characters and thus
            weakening them for the later levels. The game also switches to different mode for the boss fights. By turns,
            the player has to dodge an attack from the boss and then do a attack on his own by pressing Punch at the
            time when a moving cross-hair is over the boss.

        <plot>Yu Yu Hakusho II: Gekito! Shichi Kyo no Tatakai is based on the the manga / anime series Yu Yu Hakusho,
            which is about the teenage delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, who is appointed as an &quot;Underworld Detective&quot;
            after being killed in a car accident while trying to save a child&apos;s life. His task is to investigate
            various cases involving ghosts and demons in the human world. While the first game was a side-scrolling beat
            &apos;em up featuring four characters from the manga, the second game is a one-on-one fighting game. The
            game though does take a different approach than games like Street Fighter, as you do not control the
            movement of your character, as both opponents stand still. You fight by pressing a combination of buttons to
            make your character perform a certain attack. The efficiency of the attack depends on two factors: The
            position of a moving cross-hair on the body of your opponent, which determines the spot you attack, and the
            amount of energy in a displayed &quot;move gauge&quot; which increases over the time. To perform a special
            attack, you also need a certain amount of Ki energy which is displayed in another gauge. The Ki regenerates
            while it&apos;s not used further, and without Ki a player is limited to only normal attacks. The triggered
            attacks are then displayed in an anime style animation sequence showing both opponents doing their
            corresponding move. In single player mode (a two-player mode is available via linking two Game Gears), one
            may either play a tournament or single fight against a character of one&apos; choice. However, not all
            fighters are accessible from the beginning (the single combat mode also starts with one character less than
            the tournament mode) and must be unlocked by progressing in the game (progress is saved with passwords).
            Altogether, there are seven characters to choose from: Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, Itsuki, Toguro and
            Sensui Shinobu.
