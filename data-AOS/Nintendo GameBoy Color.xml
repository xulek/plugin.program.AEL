        <plot>007: The World is Not Enough is based off of the 1999 James Bond film of the same name. In it, Pierce
            Brosnan&apos;s Bond must investigate the murder of a British oil tycoon and attacks on his new pipeline,
            which leads to a larger sinister plot requiring gunplay and frequent flier miles to diffuse.&amp;#xA;In
            contrast to the Nintendo 64 and Playstation versions, this game only has eight missions and features a 2D
            overhead view instead of a 3D first-person. There is no multiplayer, no difficulty levels, and no save
            feature. Passwords are used to skip to later levels and unlock certain cheats.

            all aliens and rescuing all survivors, or finding a keycard to open the level exit. Before each level, the
            player can choose from five different characters, all rated differently in speed and stamina (i.e. health).
            Should a marine be drained of health, he or she is not killed, but captured. Another character can attempt a
            rescue and is given 200 seconds. If the captured soldier is not found within that time span, that character

        <plot>Asterix and Obelix (based on the French comic book series), must embark on a journey from the forests of

            side-scrolling adventure game.&amp;#xA;This title is somewhat non-linear, and allows players to choose the
            order in which to visit stages, as well as the numerous mini-games. The stage-select screen is a mini-map,
            and after selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix, players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra
            energy, hints and passwords are found here), as well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games become

            style shield-matching game to humorous events such as &quot;Throw a Roman Mini Game&quot;.&amp;#xA;Both
            Asterix and Obelix play differently as they have individual abilities and limitations. Asterix is more
            nimble, can run faster and jump higher, whereas Obelix is more powerful (being able to bash through some
            walls) but noticeably slower. These differences are highlighted by the obstacles presented in the stages -
            there are many jumps to make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers, boars, centurions) to dispose of. In
            the quest to find Dogmatix, it is vital to collect keys hidden within the levels to make available new
            areas. Similarly, it is also important to collect coins from beaten enemies as they allow the purchases at

        <plot>Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player must place 3 patterned balls next to each other in order to
            clear them. It is somewhat similar to Puyo Puyo in this respect. However Ballistic places the player in the
            center of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the
            player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and
            reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player
            which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls
            destroyed must be maximized.&amp;#xA;Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge
            one another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player&apos;s success results in additional
            balls on the other player&apos;s screen which they then must clear.

            ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the &apos;90s but was also very popular due
            to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using
            OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).&amp;#xA;At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is
            ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents&apos; cars
            on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to
            damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves
            earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime
            during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups
            strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by
            racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight.&amp;#xA;Carmageddon
            is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.

            is to destroy bricks with the use of a ball but with the difference that the paddle used to do so here is a
            dragon which when still curls up in a ball. For every ball that the player loses the dragon will shrink
            until there is nothing left of it. There is also a time limit for every level so the player can not take too
            long. Therefore it&apos;s possible to increase the speed level of the ball but there is no way to decrease
            it except by losing a ball (and restarting with a new one) or by getting a specific power up. Other power
            ups include those that add extra time or increase the dragon&apos;s movement speed. The player can also
            transform his dragon into other types of dragons that have special abilities. These become available as the
            player destroys bricks and is represented by a power gauge at the top of the screen. These abilities include
            freezing time, deflecting the ball in mid-air, shooting fireballs that destroy bricks and a web that can
            block off certain paths through the level. Random events featuring dragon gods can happen and will lead to
            different effects such as earthquakes or restored health. The game consists of one hundred levels with every
            tenth being a boss level. There is also a versus mode where two players can link up against each other. The
            players choose one of ten levels and compete in trying to clear the most bricks. For every five seconds the
            player with the least bricks cleared during that time gets an extra row of bricks added. The one that clears
            his screen first will win.

        <plot>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story
            takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first
            game&apos;s hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and
            spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of
            monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father&apos;s
            brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.&amp;#xA;Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you
            travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters,
            buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up
            monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle -
            as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night.&amp;#xA;You
            begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party.
            During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The
            recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and
            wizard.&amp;#xA;The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters&apos;
            classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other
            beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character
            switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the
            abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able
            to cast spells and fight effectively.

        <plot>Your mission is to construct a communicator so that E.T. can phone home. And just like Elliott and his
            friends in the movie, you&apos;ll have your work cut out for you. In this release for Game Boy Color, you
            must search 60 environments for all the components needed to build the transmitter. All the while, you have
            to evade capture by government agents and avoid the clever traps they&apos;ve set for you. You can alternate
            playing as the strategic-minded Elliott or as E.T., whose extraordinary powers, including levitation, can
            help you out of the many tricky situations you&apos;ll confront. This single-player game features three
            levels of difficulty and three modes of gameplay: exploration, quest, and encounter. Six large maps with 10
            environments in each extend playability, as do 45 challenging miniquests that unlock hidden items you can
            trade later.

            Slate. Within the restaurant, the Player (as Fred or Barney) has to assemble giant burgers by walking over
            the parts (bun, salad and so on) and causing them to drop onto a plate lower in the level. While doing so,
            Fred/Barney have to fend of a multitude of pests and avoid being attacked by enemies.&amp;#xA;Certain extras
            (Buffalo Hat, Club, Elvis Guitar etc.) grant time limited special powers such as speed, invincibility or the
            help of Dino, the Flintstones pet dinosaur.&amp;#xA;The game has 25 Levels, some scrolling horizontally.
            Multiplayer competition mode is possible over link cable.&amp;#xA;It also features cartoon cut scenes with
            the Flintstones characters. Progress is tracked via password.

        <plot>In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the
            mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.&amp;#xA;The
            action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty
            City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To
            finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over
            pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the&amp;#xA;big points are made through jobs.
            Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple &quot;ditch-a-hot-car&quot;
            jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score
            substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more
            points.&amp;#xA;Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player&apos;s
            wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level
            whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the
            cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is
            deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several
            lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score
            multiplier being lowered.&amp;#xA;The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out
            while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be
            freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket
            launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero)
            and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of
            different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very

            the player at the end of the year. If the farm is successful, he allows the play to keep farming a few more
            years. If not, he gives the player a second chance, because if they don&apos;t get their act together, he&apos;ll
            reclaim the land and develop it into an amusement park. The player chooses to play as either a boy or a
            girl, and then chooses if they want a dog or a cat as a pet (the pet choice slightly effects gameplay). The
            dog keeps other dogs from invading your farm at night, and the cat will occasionally bring items to the
            player&apos;s house. Livestock includes cows (for milk), chickens (for eggs) and sheep (for wool). A horse
            may also be eventually obtained for riding and work. The player&apos;s income primarily comes from crops.
            They are raised from seeds and must be watered every day until the harvest. The player can then sell them.
            Sometimes plants will produce more than one harvest. Crops can be grown all year long, but a greenhouse must
            be built in order to grow flowers and herbs during all seasons. Tools can be used to help with work, and
            include axes, hoes, hammers, watering cans, sickles, fishing rods, pickaxes and umbrellas. Unlike the
            previous game, there is no dating/romance feature.

            only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported.&amp;#xA;Players begin by placing a geometric shape
            (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon. The CPU or human opponent then places
            another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece. Players score
            bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent
            into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute
            a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played. In
            that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as
            many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)&amp;#xA;In Japan, this game has seen

        <plot>Hollywood Pinball is a pinball game with seven tables with different themes: Shark!, Terror Dactyl!,
            Double Agent, The Legend of Robin Hood, Galaxy Wars, Ancient Temple of the Aczecs and Motel Hell. All tables
            are clearly inspired by movie franchises, e.g. Indiana Jones, and have no major differences regarding their
            setup. As always the goal is to keep the ball on the table as long as possible and accumulating points for
            the high score by hitting obstacles like bumpers. Every table also has a special quest which rewards many
            points, e.g. collecting (i.e. bumping into) rockets and then hitting a special target.

            need to collect all red diamonds.As the title suggests, your aim should be the black diamonds. Once all the
            red ones have been collected, you can kill enemies to receive black diamonds. Hugo attacks using his whip -
            a single hit will stun foes, the second finishes them off. The challenge is in trying to avoid the enemies
            until you have collected all red diamonds. If you kill them too early, you will only receive coins or
            power-ups. Each level is time restricted - if time runs out, all enemies turn red and move much faster.

            is the engine size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player has less time to react, and going head to

            stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp turns in a limited space.&amp;#xA;While it
            can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks the player can obtain some powerups - a
            bomb will knock down the next opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the
            player to barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the skull and bones

        <plot>Keep the balance! is a puzzle game, where you have to balance a big weighing scale. The longer it stays in
            balance the more point you gain. To do this, you have a catapult at your disposal, the objects you need to
            use to balance the scale are given to you by conveyor belt. One on the left and one on the right. But these
            objects differ in weight, so you must carefully choose the scales bucket you&apos;re going to put the
            objects in. To make things worse, all kinds of trouble appear on screen to make it just a little bit more
            challenging. Like crocodiles that eat object or jokers that throw around playing cards offsetting your
            carefully balance scale. The game stages 5 different game worlds each divided into 16 levels.

            with a mallet (or rolling pin for Lola). They also both feature unique special abilities. Bugs Bunny can dig

            3x3 system is also used for special attacks and magic systems. Each character has a power in one colour;

            government project, codenamed &quot;Babel&quot;, attempts to revive the Metal Gear project - development of
            a highly destructive mech weapon. But an organization known as Gindran Liberation Front hijacked the Metal
            Gear prototype, without which any further development would be useless. Solid Snake is sent to infiltrate
            Outer Heaven, a location not entirely unfamiliar to him, and to retrieve the prototype.&amp;#xA;The game is
            similar in style and gameplay to early Metal Gear games. It is viewed from top-down perspective, and its
            gameplay is mostly based on stealth. Snake has to sneak past the guards, using various tactics to distract
            them or to kill them silently. Weapons, gadgets, and moves are all similar to those used in the other Metal
            Gear Solid game. From time to time Snake will also encounter bosses whom he will have to defeat in order to
            proceed to the next area. Virtual Missions for Snake are also included in this release.

        <plot>Metal Walker is a mechanical take on Pokémon, where the story takes place in the future on an island where
            a mysterious element called core has been discovered. This &quot;core&quot; element was used to create a
            highly advanced race of robots called Metal Walkers that are used for both labor and protection for the
            people of the island. One day, however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end up killing a very prominent
            member of the island. The player then takes control of the son, Tetsuo, with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo&apos;s
            Metal Walker in an attempt to hunt down the rebel robots and avenge his father&apos;s death.&amp;#xA;The
            gameplay is very similar to Pokémon, where the player explores various areas of the island searching for
            clues called Data Packets and battling other Metal Walkers or wild Walkers called Metal Busters, but instead
            of capturing these walkers, the player instead destroys them. Destroying these other Walkers results both in
            scrap metal and items called Capsules that can be used to upgrade or &quot;evolve&quot; Tetsuo&apos;s Walker
            into a more advanced form. Additionally, the player can take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they can
            also be turned into capsules as well. Additionally, capsules can not only contain power-ups, but traps as
            well that can be used in battles.&amp;#xA;The battles are also different, whereas this one the attacks
            consists of rolling attacks that are angled off of the walls of arenas. Additionally, if a player fights
            multiple opponents, all of the enemies will be present on the screen at one time and if they choose the
            right attack and angle, can result in multiple hits on multiple opponents.&amp;#xA;There are also three
            types of Walkers: Land, Marine, and Sky where, just like in Pokémon, susceptible to the other (ex. Land
            walkers have advantages over Marine walkers but are vulnerable and weaker to Sky Walker attacks). Base camps
            can also be built around various areas of the island and can be used for restoring the health of the players
            Walker.&amp;#xA;As the player progresses farther into the game, they will encounter over 100 different
            Walkers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as bosses that have to be defeated in order to
            access more areas of the island. Players can also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal Walkers or
            even exchange their base camps.

            and get an edge on your opponents.&amp;#xA;The first time you travel to a new world via the train, Casey

            Speedway USA is an isometric racing game that uses the same engine as Mickey&apos;s Racing Adventure.
            Players can choose from Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy or Pete (and some secret characters too) as
            they race around various famous cities and landmarks from the United States, including Los Angeles, the
            Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Montana, and Yellowstone, just to name a few.&amp;#xA;The Adventure Mode of the
            game plays out Grand Prix style. You must complete four races in each world, and at the end of each race,
            you&apos;re given points based on your placing. The player with the most points at the end of the four races
            wins the trophy for that circuit. There are assorted power-ups that help you as you race, including the
            Baseball Chucker (a projectile), the Magno Flyer (a homing missile), the Carbo Spritzer (a turbo), and the
            Paint Splotcher (an oil slick).&amp;#xA;There is also a Time Trial mode which lets you race any track that
            you&apos;ve previously unlocked - while you can use it to practice tracks, the goal is to race fast enough
            to beat the track&apos;s lap time and earn a gold star in every race. Another mode is Professor Von Drake&apos;s
            &apos;Driving School&apos;. In this mode, you must complete specific tasks given to you, such as parking,
            reverse parking and slalom driving. The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you will receive
            (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal). However, you will receive a time penalty if you hit a cone
            or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy counts as well.&amp;#xA;Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA supports
            many of the Game Boy Color&apos;s functions - you can play a two-player link cable race, transfer data from
            Mickey&apos;s Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of
            Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak. As you progress through the game, you&apos;ll unlock many

        <plot>6 Puzzle Games designed by Alexey Pajitnov, the original Tetris designer, on one Gameboy Color cartdridge.&amp;#xA;Jewel
            Chase. A level based game. Every level consists of a labyrinth of colored pathways, scattered valuables,
            locked doors, keys, a thief (the player), on some levels an opposing thief and a door marked exit. The goal
            is to reach the exit to proceed to the next level, valuables can be &apos;stolen&apos; for score. If the
            opposing (computer controlled) thief reaches the exit before the player, the game is lost. Movement is not
            possible between differently colored tiles, unless a special, multicolor &apos;bridge&apos; stone is used.
            99 levels total.&amp;#xA;Spring weekend. A rotation puzzle, where a given pattern needs to be recreated by
            rotating elements on the playfield.&amp;#xA;Lineup. Using &apos;Tetris&apos; style blocks, a continuous line
            from a screen border to an opposite screen border needs to be build. Elements appear on an element stack,
            and can be selected freely from that and subsequently placed anywhere on screen, without overlapping each
            other. If the element stack is full, the game is over. As soon as a line is complete, the elements of that
            line are removed from the screen. Elements appear faster over time.&amp;#xA;Finty Flush. A grid on top of
            the screen fills slowly with multicolor balls. The player can pick one out of 4 squares on the bottom of the
            screen to shift balls in one line into and out of these squares. The squares can be rotated in 90 degree
            steps. As soon as any square is completely full with balls of the same color, its content empties to make
            room for more balls. 3 filled square grids grant a bonus point, and the next level begins (tiles appear
            faster). The game is over when the upper grid is full.&amp;#xA;Color Collison. A &apos;Qix&apos; style ray (
            no better way to describe this - for the younger audience - imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing
            speed through a screen full of obstacles. The player can only indirectly control it - any time the direction
            pad is pressed, it gets &apos;reflected&apos; into the direction that has been indicated. Objective is to
            hit obstacles with a given color and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top things of, the patterns
            change over time.&amp;#xA;The game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit too many times.&amp;#xA;Rat
            Poker. Little differently colored rats are automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth design changing
            and getting more complex during level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the rats to arrange certain
            color combinations (&apos;hands&apos;) of rats. If a given combination is achieved, the contributing rats
            exit the playfield through a door. You progress to the next level if a given number of rats has been removed
            from the game. The game ends if there is no space left on the playfield for additional rats.

            In this version of the game players control two anti-missile silos and have to shoot down the incoming enemy
            firepower in order to defend several different major cities (such as Cairo or Moscow) that have come under
            siege. Cities consist of six different buildings, which the player has to try and prevent their destruction.
            If all the buildings are destroyed, the player loses the game. Both missile silos are equipped with fifteen
            missiles each and can be fired independently of each other. Players aim their missiles by moving a cursor to
            the desired location. The Game Boy version of the game was later re-released for the Game Boy Color. This
            updated version included color graphics and added a rumble feature.

        <plot>Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save
            your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick
            is your sibling.&amp;#xA;Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can
            train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a
            sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina,
            knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.&amp;#xA;In all of the
            aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions
            are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to
            imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to
            shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and
            buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity
            of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge
            does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every
            stat by a small amount. Finally, you can &apos;date&apos; your monkeys, either with each other, with a
            friend&apos;s monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining
            monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom.&amp;#xA;During boxing
            matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as
            refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent.
            These matches are won by either a count or by KO&apos;ing the opponent, however if time runs out before
            there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.

            but closely based on the design of the original Montezuma&apos;s Revenge. While some of the 150 levels are
            directly ported over, the majority are new. Another major difference is that the camera is closer to the
            action, i.e. the levels scroll instead of fitting into a single screen.The premise is the same as always:
            The player takes the role of an adventurer who explores a pyramid in order to steal all its treasures. In
            each level, the goal is to grab all treasures and reach the exit without dying, which happens instantly when
            touching one of the numerous enemies or falling from too large a height. Since the player has no attack
            option besides rarely found daggers, the majority of the game is spent dodging by using ladders or jumping.
            Other obstacles besides enemies are closed doors which have to be opened with keys, conveyor belts,
            teleporters, disappearing platforms or the time limit. Power ups grant temporary advantages such as the
            ability to walk through enemies or kill them by touch.

            down, and sends the friends to unexpectedly different time locations. Now it&apos;s up to their friends -
            Animal and Kermit - to go to these locations and bring them back home. Jim Henson&apos;s Muppets is an
            arcade game based on the TV program The Muppets Show. Players control either Animal or Kermit to different
            time locations which hold their friends. There are a total of 6 locations. Players can freely choose the
            location they want to play. Each location contains 3 selectable levels and an unlockable level (can only be
            played after finishing the selectable levels). The selectable levels have the same objective: find your way
            to the goal. The unlockable is where you encounter with a boss and save your friend. Animal fights using his
            drum sticks, while Kermit throws paper planes at enemies. Enemies (except the bosses) cannot identify the
            players&apos; character, therefore don&apos;t fight at all. They simply just move from side to side. There
            are some items that aid players during the game: food (increase health), heart (give players one life), drum
            sticks (when playing as Animal)/paper planes (when playing as Kermit). Pressing a combination of button can
            enable Animal and Kermit to use special moves: Animal&apos;s earthquake and Kermit&apos;s super high jump.
            The graphics are in 2D. Players can save their process by choosing &quot;Save&quot; in the level choosing
            menu. At the beginning of a level or when players die, Statler and Waldorf will present exchanging a short

            Fifth Element. Unlike the version for console and PC, the handheld presents the races in a top-down view
            with less features and options. The game consists of several divisions of 2 tracks each. Only the first
            division is available from the start, others are unlocked by placing first in all races of earlier ones. At
            the beginning, only the taxi (as driven by Bruce Willis&apos; character in the film) can be used. Further
            cars must be purchased with money won in the races (by placing first, second or third). Eight different cars
            are available to buy, differing in ratings for power, traction and shield strength. The more powerful cars
            can only be bought upon reaching higher divisions. Progress through the game is stored via passwords. Races
            are against three opponents, take place on circular courses and consist of four laps. The futuristic
            hovercars have the ability to change altitude, either driving on the ground or high in the air. Flying high
            is necessary for maximum speed, but there are obstacles on the track that can only be passed by driving
            under them. There are also power-ups that can only be picked up when on the ground. These include missiles,
            shields, speed boosts, slowdown bubbles and short-time invulnerability. An arrow is always in view and
            points out corners and, when in high altitude, obstacles.

            lot of statistics. The game handles matches in three different ways, playing them, watching them or a
            text-based interface similar to Championship Manager, but with highlights shown in the top-down view. If you
            don&apos;t want to play through the whole season, you can play single matches against the AI or another

            goblin king. As these fall from the sky it&apos;s the player&apos;s job to arrange them so that a cluster of
            three or more elements of the same type is created. These elements will then be cleared from the playing
            field. When the player succeeds with doing this his Power Sword gets charged and when it&apos;s fully
            powered the level is completed. The player fails if the stack of elements reaches the top of the screen. But
            there are more challenges as some levels have monsters that throw indestructible skull blocks that quickly
            fills up the playing field. To combat these monsters the player has access to a limited supply of adventurer&apos;s
            tools. Some of these, like daggers and bombs, do direct damage on the target that it&apos;s dropped on but
            can also be used to help clearing the elements. Daggers will take out an entire column of elements while
            hearts act as a wildcard and potions remove all elements of a sort from the playing field. There are also
            keys that can be used to unlock chests or get access to new areas of the playing field. Some special puzzles
            exist too for the player to figure out. For example dropping a water element on a flower will give an extra
            tool. The game three modes: quest, time challenge and training. There are more than fifty levels split over
            five different realms. The fifth realms is only made available if the player succeeds in completing the
            first four and collects all the ancient objects.

        <plot>Quest RPG: Brian&apos;s Journey is simple RPG game, related with Quest 64. Game&apos;s action takes place
            in Celtland, a fantastic medieval world. A player controls an apprentice mage - Brian. He lived in small
            town. One day the town was attacked by monsters. Now, Brian must go on a quest to restore peace and harmony.
            The game is a top-down RPG; the player moves on the map, talks to various characters, and fights against
            enemies, like crocodiles, wolves or knights. Brian can use four elements to make spells: Fire, Water, Earth
            and Wind, and combine them to create special moves. He can use hand-attack too, but this hits less strong.
            Battles are &quot;turn-based&quot;: the player moves in small squares, and chooses his attack. He can also
            dodge enemy&apos;s attacks.

            toxic waste. George has turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some sort
            of gigantic wolf. The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and then embark on a path of
            destruction encompassing the entire globe.&amp;#xA;The player chooses one of these three characters and
            begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks. The
            ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities where they are located.
            Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way. Scumlabs
            and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play
            simultaneously.&amp;#xA;The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful &quot;cartoon&quot;
            flavor. Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to
            destroy them. Once all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and
            players proceed to the next stage. Players can get many different kinds of power-ups that make them more

            possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.&amp;#xA;Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the
            game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a
            two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.

            Robopon Dispatching Company. The player starts with one Robopon, named Sunny, and must travel Porombo island
            as he/she collects Robopon and uses them to battle other Robopon Collectors. The collectors primarily played
            against are known as the &quot;Legend 7&quot;, who are the top-ranked collectors of Robopon on the island.
            When Cody beats a Legend 7 member, he takes their rank. To improve Robopon, they must be upgraded by adding
            software or other parts to them. Each part has a certain amount of space for storing software and will
            determine what attacks can be used by the Robopon. Software can be mixed to generate special attacks.
            Ultimately, Robopon plays a lot like Pokémon. Fighting is turn based and is between two Robopon owners who
            tell their Robopon to issue attacks or go on the defensive. Robopon can be healed in mid-battle with spells
            (which can be bought in town shops or stumbled upon between towns) or taken to a Robopon dispatch center and
            healed in their machine. One thing where Robopron differs from Pokémon is that in battle, a defeated Robopon
            sometimes will drop add-on items which get claimed by the winner. When a new game is started, the game asks
            for the player&apos;s birth date which is actually used by the game to select the first Robopon the player
            will start with.

            through alien disguises and accompanies him during his work: catching aliens to save the world. The gameplay
            principle is simple: the player walks through 15 levels with a fixed camera perspective and shoots
            everything he sees, e.g. werewolves or vampires. To do this he uses one of the many weapons he finds - all
            of them have unlimited ammo but have to regenerate energy during pauses of fire. But the player doesn&apos;t
            kill his enemies for good: He has to catch them with his alien trap (which is a matter of pressing one
            button) or they regenerate. Besides the shooting the game also features its share of puzzles, e.g.
            activating a mechanism, and bosses. There is also a mini game which comes into place whenever Logan has to
            disable a bomb or open a lock: basically a series of quick time events where the player has to press the
            correct button with the right timing. The levels are divided into five areas: London, Ireland, San
            Francisco, a Maya temple and Roswell.

        <plot>Sabrina is no newcomer to computer gaming, and this is her second appearance on the Game Boy Color.
            Sabrina Spooked is aimed at 6 to 9 year olds, so the basic story line is straightforward: Sabrina and her
            faithful cat Salem follow their aunts through a magic portal; there they discover that the Spooky Man--a
            baddie, of course--has kidnapped them in order to steal their magic powers, along with those of the world&apos;s
            other witches and wizards. Sabrina sets out to foil the Spooky Man&apos;s plan, using a range of spells
            across four different gaming worlds. The game takes a platform format--you move around and over obstacles,
            knocking out the enemy on the way. Zapping presents is a good idea, as this reveals goodies such as extra
            health, spells, and lives. Each level has an exit portal that&apos;s only opened when you&apos;ve found
            three crystals. When Sabrina gets to a portal she has to survive a trap set by the Spooky Man. There are no
            shortcuts to getting this job done. You can switch between controlling Sabrina or Salem. Salem is quite
            small, making him very useful for getting through tiny spaces--but he can&apos;t defeat enemies, so you need
            to think carefully about when best to use him.

            the Animated Series: Zapped! follows the pre-teen Sabrina as she tries to fix a spell that&apos;s gone
            wrong: by using her magic to get applause during the school talent show, she accidentally turned the
            audience into a pack of wild animals. Now, through 20 levels, Sabrina and her cat Salem will have to use
            quick thinking and unpredictable magic to make things right. Players will switch between Sabrina and Salem,
            and use each character&apos;s abilities to track down each of the animals and zap it back into its former
            human self.

            Fred, Velma and Daphne are on the trail of a jewel thief. Their investigation leads them to an old spooky

            jewel thief. Gameplay consists of positioning characters close to objects in such a way that a menu at the
            bottom of the screen lights up. The player can then choose the correct action (examine, search, use, take)
            from the menu. There is also plenty of dialogue involved. To solve puzzles, the player switches between

        <plot>Until now, Scrabble has generally been reserved for days when you&apos;re stuck inside during the British
            summer holidays when it&apos;s raining. But the little game with the letter tiles has made it onto the Game
            Boy, so now you can have all of that scrabbly goodness in the palm of your hand. As well as the standard
            game--where you get some letters, make spellings up and then shout &quot;what do you mean there&apos;s no
            such word as QXZYJHD?&quot;, there is also a conundrum round where you and your opponents get the same seven
            letters and have to arrange them into a word. You can play against up to three other players (either
            computer players or friends--although you&apos;ll all have to use the same machine as the game doesn&apos;t
            make use of the link cable). If you play against the computer you can choose a difficulty level--Novice,
            Easy, or Hard--and the pictorial representation of the opponent changes depending on which level you play,
            from a man with a dunce&apos;s hat to the expert who looks like Einstein. It&apos;s a nice touch which gives
            you the impression of playing against someone rather than just the computer AI. There are also various
            options you can choose to spice up play: you can set &quot;word challenge&quot; to on so that your opponent
            can dispute a word you put down (otherwise the dictionary will do it automatically when you place your
            tiles; the intelligence of this changes as you go up difficulty levels), and you can also turn off the
            &quot;miss a turn&quot; function when you get a word wrong. It&apos;s very simple to pick up and play, and
            the board is reproduced in the original colours. Basically, this is a very addictive game for people of all
            ages.

        <plot>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to &quot;the Tank. The Tank was
            based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier. Now, over 20 years later, a new
            Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. And none too soon, because
            the Invaders are back!&amp;#xA;Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision. (See
            Battlezone and Asteroids.) But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari. The game
            stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.&amp;#xA;You can play either one or two
            players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill
            levels. You&apos;ll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and
            finally Earth. There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common
            ones. You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row. As in
            the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit
            them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots. Plus, after fighting off several
            waves on each planet, you&apos;ll face a unique boss. If you manage to finish the game, you&apos;ll be able
            to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.

            scrolling shooter game with two modes of play. Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with
            pre-designed layouts. A few levels are different, though: top-down perspective, with a randomized layout.
            Either way, the player is armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring)
            and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything on screen.&amp;#xA;Space Marauder is the Game Boy Color
            version of Burai Fighter. Game play is exactly the same. Like Burai Fighter it offers the same three
            difficulties (Eagle, Albatross and Ace), but the game features different level layouts. It doesn&apos;t

        <plot>Space Station Silicon Valley is a based on the Nintendo 64 game of the same name. It keeps story, gameplay
            mechanics and even the basic level design while translating everything into a platforming perspective shown
            from the side. The story is about a space station which is populated by independent robot animals. A while
            ago the station vanished but now it is back on full collision course towards Earth. Of course humanity sends
            squads out there to end the threat, but everyone but the robot Evo gets lost. The player takes the role of
            Evo who has to solve 35 levels in order to save Earth. The unique characteristic of the game is that Evo has
            the ability to take control over any robot animal he meets. In fact, he is required to do so because his
            life energy rapidly decreases when outside of a host. All those animals have different abilities which are
            used to solve the numerous puzzles found in the levels. There are varying goals to complete in each level
            which range from destroying a machine to guiding sheep to their pens.

            is a platformer with some shooter elements. It contains both horizontal and vertical sections. You must make

            and kicking, but there are some guns with rather limited ammunition to find along the way. There is also one
            stage where Spawn rids a motorcycle, somewhat along the lines of the surfing and skating levels in Teenage
            Mutant Ninja Turtles.&amp;#xA;There are three difficulty modes. In each mode, enemies can take more damage.
            One punch will knock out any minor enemy in easy and you can start at any stage. It takes two in normal and
            you must play through from stage one. On hard, it takes several, so the fighting becomes much more
            strategic. You must beat the game on hard mode to get the real ending.

            Sylvester the cat has kidnapped all mice from Speedy&apos;s village and Speedy has to free them. The focus

            There are six levels in total with three stages each (some of them spent in a boat or underwater) and one
            boss per level.

            strange, seemingly uninhabited island and ultimately find a way to return home.&amp;#xA;Survival Kids is
            presented in an overhead action-RPG style similar to Link&apos;s Awakening. Players must try to survive
            through each day by getting enough rest, eating food and drinking water regularly. This can be risky, as
            certain foods such as mushrooms can have varying effects including paralysis and poison, while other foods
            can go rotten and make you sick if you eat it.&amp;#xA;The game also features a unique &quot;merge&quot;
            system, which allows you to create a number of different items by combining two other items. For example,
            combining bark and a stick would produce kindling, while using ivy with a bent stick could create a bow.
            There are plenty of useless items that can be made in addition to the essentials, so it&apos;s up to the
            player to think as to what could be helpful in their quest to survive.

            available as hidden bonuses. Races are seen from a top-down perspective. The modes are similar to those in

            are available that have to be taken on in order, unlocking tracks in the process. Winnings from races can be
            spent to purchase new cars. After every race, power up points are awarded that can be used to improve the
            car in acceleration, top speed, traction and gearing. It is also possible to equip the car with a GPS, which
            provides a map of the track during a race, and with further enhancements, the locations of all drivers. Also
            available are power bursts and power winches. Bursts give a short speed burst, while winches can be used to
            quickly reset the car to a checkpoint if it becomes stuck at an obstacle like mud or water. Single Race mode
            allow players to race on unlocked tracks with their purchased cars. In Patrol Chase mode, players can select
            from special cop variants of three different cars, with the goal being chasing down the other cars on the
            track and giving them tickets by ramming into them. The game cartridge has a rumble feature that lets

            a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much
            everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending
            himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid
            them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing
            plains: from the player&apos;s perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can
            switch between the two at any time.

            controlling a member of the Rainbow counterterrorism unit, responsible for resolving hostage situations and
            neutralizing threats, in sixteen missions.&amp;#xA;The limitations of the platform are not traded in for an
            arcade-like approach. Just like the major computer version it stresses careful planning and tactics. After a
            briefing that needs to be followed attentively, the player assumes the role of the commander and assembles a
            squad of eight operatives, each with different statistics and abilities, based on character traits such as
            aggression and self-control, physical elements such as stamina, and specific skills including stealth,
            firearms, electronics, demolitions and many other types of weapons. They can be divided into up to four
            independent teams. Next, the operatives are outfitted with a selection of six different rifles, six
            different handguns, 24 types of armor or camouflage and additional tools including heartbeat sensors and
            door charges. Default equipment is suggested right away, but that is not sufficient for later missions. In
            the planning mode, the last part of the pre-mission activities, the commander needs to set out waypoints on
            the map and determine the course of action.&amp;#xA;The actual missions are shown in 2D where the different
            characters can sneak around, blow up doors, rescue hostages and engage the enemy, all requiring a tactical
            approach. The general plot points and mission objectives are true to the computer version.

            open and have to be explored in order in order to find the cats, especially by using Tweety&apos;s flutter
            ability. The player has to tap a button rapidly in order to keep him in the air longer. On the other hand,
            he has no standard attack and has to use items found in the levels, e.g. banana peels or acorns. The cats
            have to be overwhelmed with those items to get access to their paws. Of course there are also other enemies
            which take away a part of Tweety&apos;s life energy when touched. There is also a two-player mode in which

            During the matches, the opponents try to perform moves while both wrestlers are close together (basically by
            holding a direction and pressing buttons with the correct timing) to diminish the opponent&apos;s energy.
            This is necessary so his shoulders can be held to the mat for three seconds, which ends the match. One
            speciality of this game is the possibility to leave the ring and fight in the locker room or on the street.
            Besides the career mode (trying to win the WCW title by passing through lower leagues with lower difficulty)
            and single matches against the AI, there is also the option to play against another human participant.

            islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you&apos;ll have to use rockets
            to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers
            with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights
            with enemy fighter planes.&amp;#xA;&amp;#xA;You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier,
            which you&apos;ll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel,

            try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a
            team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to
            dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep.&amp;#xA;Everything is presented in a
            humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or
            despair, depending on how you do.&amp;#xA;Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and

            punks security guards and even other WWF superstars with a punch, kick, a dropkick or through various
            weapons scattered throughout the stage such as steel pipes, nightsticks, 2x4&apos;s along with many more
            objects. Not only does the player have to defeat enemies they also have to avoid various traps and pitfalls
            such as patches of fire, floor traps and laser cannons to name a few.&amp;#xA;There are also power-ups that
            are located in various places throughout the game which can replenish the player&apos;s health and power bar
            among many others. Additionally, when the player fills up their power bar they can unleash their character&apos;s

        <plot>Zebco Fishing! is an officially licensed fishing game for the Game Boy Color. It features 11 different
            lures and 2 lakes to fish on. The player can participate in a tournament and Blackjack Bass. The tournament
            mode gives you a limited time to catch the biggest fish. In Blackjack Bass you have to catch 21 pounds worth
            of fish, similar to the game Black Jack. Each time you catch a fish, you get its weight and can decide to
            &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;hold&quot;. If you exceed the 21 pounds you lose.&amp;#xA;The player can row his
            boat around the lake until he has found a suitable fishing location, where he can cast his line and wait for
            the fish to bite. Once a fish is nibbling the bait the player has to hook it and then reel it in. When you
            do so you must make sure your line doesn&apos;t break by keeping an eye on the tension.&amp;#xA;Weather
            conditions, time of day and location all have impact on the chance of catching a fish. Each type of lure
            also improves the odds in specific types of water and weather types. Somewhere in the two lakes also dwells
            the legendary Lochness Bass a giant fish which is yet to be caught.
