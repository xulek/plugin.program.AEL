        <plot>The premise of Baldies is similar to many real-time strategy games. You start with a limited number of
            Baldies with which you construct buildings, increase your population, and create the necessary instruments
            of war. There are four classes of Baldies--builders, scientists, soldiers, and workers/breeders. Structures
            include small, medium, large, and huge houses as well as science labs and barracks. Each building has
            specific properties that assist in your destruction of the enemy.

        <plot>Battlemorph is the Jaguar CD sequel to the first Jaguar cartridge, Cybermorph. This game takes place 30
            years after the original. The Pernitian empire, long thought to be extinct, is back with a vengeance. Your
            new War Griffon craft must travel to 8 different star clusters so that your star ship can find the plasma it
            needs to make it&apos;s way to the Pernish cluster. Once you take out the Pernish home world, the galaxy may
            be safe from the Pernitians once and for all.&amp;#xA;Battlemorph plays similarly to Cybermorph, except with
            some new gameplay features. Now, some missions require you to travel underground into caves and tunnels. It
            is also possible to dive under the oceans on the planet&apos;s surface. There are also many new objects,
            weapons, and enemies to interact with.
