            until they complete hands by forming groups and pairs. Players can choose to play on either a beginner,
            intermediate, or expert difficulty level. The expert skill level introduces a time limit to the proceedings.
            The game also keeps track of the score during gameplay

        <plot>Neo Geo Cup &apos;98 is a football/soccer game for the Neo Geo Pocket. This version is different from Neo
            Geo Cup &apos;98: The Road to the Victory — here playing field is vertical-scrolling, not side-scrolling.
            The game has less national teams than the bigger version — the player can choose one from 16 teams. Neo Geo
            Cup &apos;98 is an unofficial adaptation of the World Cup - SNK has made a fictional Neo Geo Cup. Gameplay
            is quite simple; the player controls a football team and must win matches against rival teams. The game uses
            simple &quot;2-buttons and stick&quot; controls (limits of the Neo Geo Pocket).

        <plot>Puzzle Link is a game where blocks of matching color have to be dissolved. New blocks constantly scroll
            into the screen from the top. The game is over when the first blocks reach the bottom of the screen. You can
            dissolve blocks by shooting at them. The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects
            otherwise unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve. There are three different modes: In
            &quot;Normal&quot; you have to link two special blocks that appear after some time. If you manage to finish
            the level within the time limit you will unlock one of 50 collectible cards. In &quot;Clear Mode&quot; you
            have to clear a given constellation of blocks. &quot;Battle Mode&quot; is a two player link-cable mode.

            know that Amakusa is really a servant of the evil Ambrosia, who had possessed and taken over Amakusa&apos;s

        <plot>Syougi (usually transliterated as shōgi) is &quot;Japanese chess&quot; - a turn-based board game (the
            board has 9x9 squares) very similar to normal chess, but all pieces are different. There we have: -1 king -1
            rook -1 bishop -2 gold generals -2 silver generals -2 knights -2 lances -9 pawns. Each unit has own move and
            all units are weaker than chess counterparts (for example Knight/Horse can&apos;t go backward), but all
            figures can be promoted and gain new moves. The player must defeat the enemy&apos;s king. Master of Syougi
            is an electronic version of this classic board game, where players can choose fight characters to fight and
            change several rules.
